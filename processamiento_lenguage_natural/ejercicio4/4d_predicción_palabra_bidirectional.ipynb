She had not cared to disguise her feelings. She would have\\r\\ngiven up all the world for him, even like Goethe’s Marguerite.

Her whole nature seemed\\r\\nto have undergone a change—a change in which pride took such full\\r\\npossession of her heart, that there was no more room left for love. She\\r\\nwho had sat and simpered over Tennyson like a love-sick, romantic girl,\\r\\ndreaming of Cophetua, and Camelot, and A. H. H., now thought of nothing\\r\\nbut schemes of revenge and ambition. If she were only in Phœbe\\r\\nTallant’s place, what would she not do to assert the rights of lowly\\r\\nbirth and beauty! She envied her friend at the moment with a hot and a\\r\\nbitter envy, and hated her own more lowly origin.',\n",

The park trees were standing in\\r\\ngolden circles of leaves; the great elms were shaking down their\\r\\nlast autumnal tributes to mother earth; the old roots were wrapped\\r\\nin soft carpet-like coverings of red and brown and gold; the long\\r\\ncarriage-drive was fringed with the same[Pg 5] remnants of the dying year, and anon a gust\\r\\nof wind would sweep along the road and carry the leaves high up into\\r\\nthe air, like flocks of birds sporting in the sunshine.',\n",

Once, and only once, previously had he\\r\\nhonoured Barton Hall with his presence. He was of a quiet, retiring\\r\\nnature; a luxurious and learned nobleman, who cared more for rare books\\r\\nand works of art and old pottery than for anything else.',\n",
              " 'He was scarcely fifty years of age,—a lithe, supple man, with brown,\\r\\ncurly hair, and evidently a quiet, luxurious fellow, who liked to\\r\\nhave his own way and take things easily. He had never been married,\\r\\nand never would marry, he said, because it would bore him. It would\\r\\nbe impossible, he had often said, for any woman to be happy with\\r\\nhim; she would be jealous of his pictures and pottery in less than a\\r\\nmonth. And then the going into society, and fulfilling those duties of\\r\\nproperty which people talked about, and laying yourself out for being\\r\\neverybody’s friend but your own:—no, he could not marry; he would leave\\r\\nthat, he said, to his brother Lionel.',\n",
              " 'It was through this brother Lionel that the Earl Verner called at\\r\\nBarton Hall this second[Pg 7]\\r\\ntime. Mr. Hammerton had, it appeared, not only invested largely himself\\r\\nin some of the bubble concerns of the day, but he had induced his\\r\\nlordship to divert considerable sums of money into the same channel;\\r\\nand now that his lordship’s steward had large demands upon him for\\r\\ncalls, Earl Verner said to himself, “I will go over and see Tallant—pay\\r\\nhim a visit of condolence, and kill two birds with one stone.”',\n",

Her whole nature seemed\\r\\nto have undergone a change—a change in which pride took such full\\r\\npossession of her heart, that there was no more room left for love. She\\r\\nwho had sat and simpered over Tennyson like a love-sick, romantic girl,\\r\\ndreaming of Cophetua, and Camelot, and A. H. H., now thought of nothing\\r\\nbut schemes of revenge and ambition. If she were only in Phœbe\\r\\nTallant’s place, what would she not do to assert the rights of lowly\\r\\nbirth and beauty! She envied her friend at the moment with a hot and a\\r\\nbitter envy, and hated her own more lowly origin.It was the morning after her return from London. She sat at\\r\\nher bedroom window at the farm, commanding a long reach of the\\r\\ncarriage-drive to Barton Hall. The park trees were standing in\\r\\ngolden circles of leaves; the great elms were shaking down their\\r\\nlast autumnal tributes to mother earth; the old roots were wrapped\\r\\nin soft carpet-like coverings of red and brown and gold; the long\\r\\ncarriage-drive was fringed with the same[Pg 5] remnants of the dying year, and anon a gust\\r\\nof wind would sweep along the road and carry the leaves high up into\\r\\nthe air, like flocks of birds sporting in the sunshine.But Amy saw only desolation in the scene; she saw all her best and\\r\\nholiest aspirations tossed about the world like the fallen leaves.\\r\\nWhilst she sat there musing and fretting by the window, there entered\\r\\nthe drive a carriage drawn by four horses; as it gradually approached,\\r\\nshe saw that there were footmen behind, and that the equipage was\\r\\nsplendid.“As there are no fairies and magicians in these days,” she said to\\r\\nherself, “that is not Cinderella’s coach, and I am not Cinderella. Why,\\r\\nit must be Earl Verner’s carriage: his brother is going to call\\r\\nat Barton Hall. I will go there too.”And as she said so, the carriage swept along, with the leaves flying\\r\\nabout the horses’ heads and sporting round the carriage wheels.Amy was right. This was Earl Verner’s carriage, and his lordship\\r\\nwas on his way to pay[Pg 6]\\r\\nMr. Tallant a personal visit. Once, and only once, previously had he\\r\\nhonoured Barton Hall with his presence. He was of a quiet, retiring\\r\\nnature; a luxurious and learned nobleman, who cared more for rare books\\r\\nand works of art and old pottery than for anything else.He was scarcely fifty years of age,—a lithe, supple man, with brown,\\r\\ncurly hair, and evidently a quiet, luxurious fellow, who liked to\\r\\nhave his own way and take things easily. He had never been married,\\r\\nand never would marry, he said, because it would bore him. It would\\r\\nbe impossible, he had often said, for any woman to be happy with\\r\\nhim; she would be jealous of his pictures and pottery in less than a\\r\\nmonth. And then the going into society, and fulfilling those duties of\\r\\nproperty which people talked about, and laying yourself out for being\\r\\neverybody’s friend but your own:—no, he could not marry; he would leave\\r\\nthat, he said, to his brother Lionel.It was through this brother Lionel that the Earl Verner called at\\r\\nBarton Hall this second[Pg 7]\\r\\ntime. Mr. Hammerton had, it appeared, not only invested largely himself\\r\\nin some of the bubble concerns of the day, but he had induced his\\r\\nlordship to divert considerable sums of money into the same channel;\\r\\nand now that his lordship’s steward had large demands upon him for\\r\\ncalls, Earl Verner said to himself, “I will go over and see Tallant—pay\\r\\nhim a visit of condolence, and kill two birds with one stone.”So his lordship sent in his card, and followed it into Mr. Tallant’s\\r\\nlibrary, where he found the merchant engaged at his desk.“Mine is rather a selfish visit, Tallant,” he said. “I fear you must\\r\\nhave thought me an unneighbourly fellow; but, you see, I am fond of\\r\\nquiet, and I rarely pay visits. Perhaps I take[Pg 8] too little interest in the county. However,\\r\\nyou will believe me when I say that I was grieved to hear of your\\r\\ndomestic trouble—deeply grieved; for I knew you had set your heart upon\\r\\nmaking that young fellow a sort of intellectual Crœsus, and——”“We will not talk about it, Mr. Tallant, but pray accept my\\r\\nsympathy; and if there is anything I can do for the young fellow—I have\\r\\nsome little influence, I am told, with the Government——”“Thank your lordship. Let us act upon your former suggestion, and\\r\\nnot talk about it. Richard Tallant is no longer my son.”There was something so calm and determined in the merchant’s manner,\\r\\nthat Lord Verner did not attempt to say any more on the subject.“‘A fellow feeling makes one wondrous kind,’ you know,” he said\\r\\nby-and-by. “My brother Lionel Hammerton, like everybody else, has\\r\\nbeen[Pg 9] drawn into\\r\\nconsiderable speculations, and, what is more, he has led me into the\\r\\npopular folly. Finance is a splendid game for those who understand it,\\r\\nno doubt; but it is worse than the turf to a novice. My steward informs\\r\\nme that I have five hundred shares in the Oriental Bank, one hundred\\r\\nin the Mardike Mines, and five hundred in the Bank of Finance. There\\r\\nare calls due upon the whole of them, and two are to be wound up in\\r\\nChancery. What shall I do in the matter?”“Pay the calls, and be prepared to pay up the whole of the Finance\\r\\nand Mining shares, and expect no return,” said Mr. Tallant. “The\\r\\nOrientals may come right, and will come right if the shareholders and\\r\\ndirectors do not succumb to the bears on the Stock Exchange.”“Thank you. I knew I should get clear and straightforward advice\\r\\nfrom you, Mr. Tallant. I[Pg\\r\\n10] have already occupied your time too long, and I see you are\\r\\nbusy. I will shake hands with Miss Tallant, and take my leave.”Mr. Tallant made no reply, but rose, and conducting his lordship to\\r\\nthe drawing-room, bade him good-morning.In the drawing-room Earl Verner found Miss Tallant and Miss\\r\\nSomerton. The former he had seen once before, the latter he now saw\\r\\nfor the first time. Phœbe was attired in her ordinary morning\\r\\nstyle, and looked fresh and blooming as a rose, but with just a trace\\r\\nof languor in her manner which did not usually characterise it. Amy\\r\\nhad astonished her friend immensely, only ten minutes previously, by\\r\\nsuddenly entering the room in a favourite delicate white merino, and\\r\\nwith unusual signs of care manifested in her toilette. Her appearance\\r\\nwas worthy of that of a duchess. She looked like a queen in her own\\r\\nright. Her head never looked nobler; the graceful curves about her\\r\\nmouth and chin seemed to be full of sunshine and happiness; her\\r\\neyes[Pg 11] sparkled with\\r\\nunwonted brilliancy, and when Lord Verner entered he found it difficult\\r\\nto remove his eyes from the lady’s face.“Pray, present me to your friend,” he said, after he had shaken\\r\\nhands with Miss Tallant, and without waiting to give Phœbe the\\r\\nvoluntary opportunity of doing so.Miss Tallant presented Amy accordingly, and his lordship was not\\r\\ndispleased to see how sensibly his rank affected her. His rank? Might\\r\\nnot his appearance have something to do with that faint blush and\\r\\nunmistakable embarrassment? The thought flashed through his lordship’s\\r\\nmind in an instant, and it flattered him. He grew quite affable, and\\r\\ninsisted, in his grand way, upon sitting down and having a little\\r\\nchat.“I am sorry,” he said to Miss Tallant, “to see your father so\\r\\nsensibly affected by late events; it really grieves\\r\\nme to the heart—such a fine business gentleman as he was, so full\\r\\nof energy and resource. I must call again and see him. I fear he is\\r\\nmoping. You must cheer him up,[Pg\\r\\n12] Miss Somerton, you must bring your high spirits to bear upon\\r\\nthe poor gentleman; he is quite downcast.”“I fear we had best not interfere with him just now, your lordship;\\r\\nthere are troubles which are better nursed and thought over. I hope Mr.\\r\\nTallant will soon be well again,” said Amy, sweetly.“Trouble ought to be quickly dispersed with such companionship as\\r\\nMr. Tallant has in his daughter and yourself,” said Lord Verner, bent\\r\\non paying Amy a compliment in return for her gracious looks.“I fear me we scarcely understand all Mr. Tallant’s troubles just\\r\\nnow, and perhaps he does not understand our sympathy and desire to\\r\\nconsole him. Your lordship is pleased to be complimentary; but there is\\r\\nlittle of woman’s society at Montem Castle, I have always heard, or you\\r\\nwould understand how easy it may be to tire of it.”“Ah, there you hit me, Miss Somerton; now really that is cruel.\\r\\nBecause I am deserted by[Pg\\r\\n13] the ladies, because I am a mopish, cross-grained, old\\r\\nbachelor, you think I am a fitting target for your sarcasm. Well, well,\\r\\nbe it so. At least I have not to bear any woman’s taunts and jests at\\r\\nmy own hearth. Ha! ha!—there, there—I think that is one to me. Don’t\\r\\nyou think so, Miss Tallant?” and his lordship laughed merrily at his\\r\\nown jocularity.Phœbe smiled a little sadly, and with a puzzled look at Amy,\\r\\nwho gave her no opportunity to reply, but raising her hand slightly to\\r\\ngive point to her words, she said:—“No, and your lordship has no woman’s sweet smiles at your fireside\\r\\neither, no chatty sympathising companion in pretty dresses to walk by\\r\\nyour side, and talk to you about all manner of things in which you are\\r\\ninterested; no cheery, pleasant womanly face at the head of your table\\r\\nmaking everything brighter about you. There—is not that one to me, as\\r\\nyour lordship puts it?”Amy smiled so coquettishly, and looked so[Pg 14] much all that she had described, that his\\r\\nlordship soon found himself in an exuberance of spirits.“Ah, I am no match for you; it is easy to see that you have lived\\r\\nin the world, Miss Somerton. Your Belgravian guns are too many for\\r\\nour poor little pop-guns in the country, eh, Miss Tallant?” said his\\r\\nlordship.“And should never desire, I think, to live anywhere else,” said Amy.\\r\\n“On the whole I think a country life by far the happiest, and the most\\r\\nindependent.”“Indeed, I think so too,” said his lordship. “There is a certain\\r\\namount of solitude in a comparatively retired country life, which\\r\\nallows the greatest scope for freedom of thought, and for manners and\\r\\nopinions.”“In what is called society, you sacrifice your liberty, you lose\\r\\nyour own individuality,” said[Pg\\r\\n15] Amy, taking up the theme in a manner that she knew would be\\r\\nhighly pleasing to Lord Verner, for she had an ample knowledge of his\\r\\nwhims and peculiarities, and she was bent upon playing her new part in\\r\\nthe most effective manner possible.“Hear, hear!—admirably well illustrated!” said Earl Verner. “In the\\r\\ncountry one is not bored with all the trumpery little gossip of town.\\r\\nThe news gets fairly sifted before it reaches us, as Gibbon, I think,\\r\\nsomewhere says. We are the lookers-on, and we can rest or give up when\\r\\nwe cease to be interested. In society, as you say, we are mixed up in\\r\\nthe throng, we are part of all that is going on, we must be interested\\r\\nin all the frivolous nonsense. O, no, nothing like the country, and\\r\\nespecially when you can occupy the mind.”From this topic, in which Phœbe took great interest, the\\r\\nEarl glided into more lively subjects, and talked of pictures and\\r\\nnew books; and he was surprised at the smartness and learning[Pg 16] evinced in some of Miss\\r\\nSomerton’s replies. She seemed to know a little of everything, and\\r\\nto express herself with such charming deference to his lordship’s\\r\\ngreater wisdom, that Earl Verner was quite delighted. He was not bored\\r\\na bit; he had never before been in the society of women, who knew\\r\\nanything about books, without being bored; he hated women who were at\\r\\nall clever as a rule; but there was an unaffected modesty, a charming\\r\\nnaïveté about this lady’s manner, which left its fascinating\\r\\nspirit upon Lord Verner long after he had left Barton Hall. Who could\\r\\nshe be, this splendid specimen of common sense and beauty?When he had fairly left the house, Miss Somerton made a curtsey to\\r\\nherself in a mirror, and said, “Très bonne, Mademoiselle, your\\r\\nacting is really most natural.”Then turning round upon Phœbe, who was gazing at her friend\\r\\nwith an expression of the most profound astonishment, she said:—“Pray forgive me, Miss Tallant; you won’t[Pg 17] cast me off for trying to outshine you this\\r\\nmorning? You will not show me the door because I am only a bailiff’s\\r\\ndaughter, and not rich?”Amy’s sarcasm astonished Phœbe more than her previously\\r\\nextraordinary manner had done, and she could only think that poor Amy\\r\\nwas not quite right in her mind.“Oh yes I am, dear. I was a poor foolish creature once; but I am\\r\\ngoing to appear in a new character in future. I will tell you all about\\r\\nit, like a dutiful companion and bailiff’s daughter, if you will not\\r\\ndenounce me.”“I fail to understand you, Amy,” said Phœbe, a little piqued\\r\\nat this undeserved reference to their relative positions.Any further explanation on Amy’s part was prevented at that time by\\r\\nan unexpected message from the farm. Mrs. Somerton was seriously ill,\\r\\nand Luke had sent for his daughter, who went hurriedly to the bedroom\\r\\nwhich was set apart[Pg 18]\\r\\nfor her at the Hall, changed her dress, and obeyed her father’s\\r\\nsummons.Mrs. Somerton had been ailing for several days. The shock which\\r\\nshe had sustained by the news of her son’s imprisonment had been but\\r\\nlittle relieved by the intelligence of his release. She had persisted\\r\\nin thinking that his life was ruined. The taint of dishonesty, though\\r\\nit had only attached to him in imagination, was upon him. He could not\\r\\nhope, she thought, to make a name after that. Everything, she said,\\r\\nwent wrong with them, and she was well punished. This had been the\\r\\nsubstance of her talk half the night when she should have been asleep,\\r\\nand in the morning, whilst Amy was acting her new part before Lord\\r\\nVerner, she had fallen from her chair, and her husband had carried her\\r\\nto bed.“I’m very ill, Amy,” she said, by-and-by,[Pg 19] “very ill. The longest day will come to an\\r\\nend at last. I hope the doctor will be here soon.”“Dear mother, you must not give way so,” Amy said, kissing her\\r\\nforehead. “What shall I get for you?”“Nothing, nothing. There’s no salve for sores of the mind, my girl,”\\r\\nreplied the sick woman. “Let me have a doctor soon,” and then she\\r\\nclosed her eyes.It happened that Luke’s messenger to Avonworth met the doctor at the\\r\\ncross roads, returning from Berne; and he came therefore soon after Amy\\r\\nentered the room. Her mother looked at him eagerly as the doctor felt\\r\\nher pulse.“Is there any danger, doctor?” she asked earnestly; “shall I die?\\r\\npray do not deceive me. I am not a young woman, and don’t expect to\\r\\nlive longer than my time; but do tell me if it has come?”“There is no danger, I assure you,” said the doctor. “You have been\\r\\nexcited lately, by some trouble perhaps—that affair of your son’s,\\r\\nwhich[Pg 20] has come all\\r\\nright, I am glad to hear. Your greatest want is quiet and repose. You\\r\\nmust not alarm or excite yourself: you will soon be better.”Amy and her father followed the doctor down-stairs to obtain a\\r\\nverification of this statement; and as they left her, Mrs. Somerton\\r\\nrepeated slowly to herself, “quiet and repose.”The next day Mrs. Somerton grew worse, and in the afternoon she\\r\\ninsisted that she was dying. The doctor, on the contrary, insisted that\\r\\nshe was not doing anything of the sort.“I must see him, Luke. There is something which he should know\\r\\nbefore I die—something of the greatest importance to others besides\\r\\nhimself. Do, pray, send for him. It does not matter what yon senseless\\r\\ndoctor says; I can feel I am dying, and I durst not die without seeing\\r\\nMr. Tallant.”So Luke communicated this strange intelligence[Pg 22] to Mr. Tallant, and that gentleman\\r\\nproceeded at once to the farm.“Oh, how ill you look, sir; how much you are changed,” said the sick\\r\\nwoman, when Mr. Tallant appeared.Mr. Tallant paid no heed to the remark, but sat down upon the\\r\\nnearest chair, and asked what she had to say to him.“They all say that,” she replied; “but sometimes the patient knows\\r\\nmore than the doctors. Luke and Amy, will you leave me with Mr.\\r\\nTallant; I have something to say to him. You will know of it hereafter,\\r\\nbut don’t stand by and hear me confess my own wickedness. I am going to\\r\\nconfess in time for a great wrong to be remedied—that is something in\\r\\nthe way of atonement.”“Yes, yes, that is some comfort. There’s little good exposing a\\r\\nwrong when it cannot be remedied,” the sick woman went on, as if\\r\\ncommuning with herself. “The very thought does me good; I shall feel\\r\\neasier when the load is off my mind.”“What is this secret, Sarah?” Mr. Tallant asked, and his thoughts\\r\\nwandered back to the time when she acted as his housekeeper; the sound\\r\\nof her Christian name coming from his own mouth seemed like the revival\\r\\nof an old memory.“You would not think I was a very ambitious woman, Mr. Tallant; it\\r\\nis true, nevertheless. I was vain and full of being great when I was a\\r\\ngirl, and all my life long I seem to have been going backwards instead\\r\\nof onwards. Nothing has come about as I expected.”“We have all our disappointments,” said Mr.[Pg 24] Tallant, dryly; “I hope you are not going\\r\\nto recount all yours.”“How hard you are, sir; how little you seem moved by my wretched\\r\\nposition. Have you no fears concerning this confession I am about to\\r\\nmake?”“None,” said the merchant; “my troubles are about over. You can’t\\r\\nhit me any harder than I have been hit already, whatever you may have\\r\\nto tell.”“You remember your second wife,” went on the woman, half raising\\r\\nherself in bed; “you remember her dark eyes, and her graceful, ladylike\\r\\nform. You remember how she wore her dark hair, and how musical her\\r\\nvoice was?”“Never,” he replied; “but why all this mystery?—go straight to the\\r\\npoint, my dear woman, at once, or I must leave you.”“I have not much more to say. I thought your own fatherly instinct\\r\\nwould have assisted me. Do you remember that you left me in charge of\\r\\nyour child after Mrs. Tallant’s death? You were so stricken with grief\\r\\nthat you never saw the child but once; and when the poor lady was\\r\\nburied you travelled on the Continent for more than six months. I had\\r\\nan infant two months old when your child was born. You left your house\\r\\nand child in my care. I was to do everything that was right and proper\\r\\nunder the circumstances. Do you remember?”The woman grew very much excited, and would not be content with Mr.\\r\\nTallant’s solemn nod in the affirmative.“Do you remember, when you returned home, that you came of your own\\r\\naccord and asked to see the child, and how you called it Phœbe,\\r\\nafter its mother—do you remember?”Here she paused to see what effect the revelation had upon her\\r\\nhearer. But she could glean nothing from Mr. Tallant’s solemn, passive\\r\\nface.She went on—“And now I can die in peace. It was all ambition. I\\r\\nthought to be somebody through the means of my child; it was not all\\r\\nfor her own sake that I did it. I thought of it night and day before\\r\\nI did it—night and day, and day and night, and I changed my mind many\\r\\na time, until at last Luke, my husband, became accustomed to the new\\r\\nface, and then I could not go back from my purpose. And yet all my\\r\\nplans fail, everything goes wrong, and this secret has burnt into my\\r\\nlife like a red-hot coal, until I am dying of it—dying of it.”Then she sank back exhausted, and the merchant sat by with his\\r\\neyes fixed upon her face, but without making the slightest effort\\r\\nto give[Pg 27] her any\\r\\nassistance. He was a good deal stunned by the woman’s revelation; but\\r\\nif all other things had been well, he could have borne it without\\r\\nscarcely a pang either of indignation or regret, for both girls\\r\\nhad been well cared for. They had lived like sisters, now for a\\r\\nlong time past, and Amy had picked up an education almost equal to\\r\\nPhœbe’s.“What proof have you of this base and ungrateful fraud?” he asked,\\r\\nwhen the woman opened her eyes again.“Look at the picture of your wife—the one which hangs in the\\r\\nlibrary—and then tell me how it is that you have not found out the\\r\\ndeception long ago. Amy grows more like the lady who is gone every day,\\r\\nand Phœbe has not a feature in her face to remind you of her.”Mr. Tallant saw the justice of the remark in an instant, and it\\r\\nseemed like a rebuke when he remembered how dearly the wife was\\r\\nbeloved. With the picture and the familiar face of the assumed Amy\\r\\nSomerton in his mind for a[Pg\\r\\n28] moment, his whole nature cried out in proof of the woman’s\\r\\nstory; and now he bethought himself of the strange interest he had\\r\\nalways taken in the girl, and how indifferent he had been in comparison\\r\\nto Phœbe, lovable as she undoubtedly was, beautiful as everybody\\r\\nmust confess her to be.It seemed for a moment as if a new link of interest between himself\\r\\nand the world had been forged by this confession.“You will wait until I am dead, sir—pray do—before you repeat my\\r\\nstory: do, do wait; I should not like to lose Luke’s respect in my last\\r\\nmoments.”“I will not divulge what you have confessed, at present at least,”\\r\\nsaid the merchant; “but justice must be done.”The merchant promised to keep her secret for the present, but she\\r\\ncould get no other promise from him.When he left her she seemed to be considerably better. Exhausted by\\r\\nthe excitement of her confession, she lay motionless when Amy and her\\r\\nfather returned. She had been slightly feverish all day; towards night\\r\\nbrain fever set in, and then the doctor confessed there was danger.Meanwhile Mr. Tallant had sent for his London lawyer, who remained\\r\\ncloseted with him all the next day. In the afternoon a clerk came down\\r\\nwith parchment and other materials for engrossing, and Mr. Christopher\\r\\nTallant made a new and final will, little thinking how soon it would\\r\\ncome to be read aloud for the benefit of the parties interested\\r\\ntherein.He had taken every means for verifying the rumours which had\\r\\nreached him concerning his son; for many days past he had had a\\r\\nprivate detective upon his track, who had laid before him unmistakable\\r\\nproofs of his son’s commercial dishonesty. The detective had even\\r\\nhunted out the[Pg 30] card\\r\\nscandal at the Ashford Club, in which Mr. Richard Tallant had not\\r\\naltogether escaped suspicion. He laid before the father shares recently\\r\\ntransferred by Richard Tallant in the Meter Iron Works Company, whose\\r\\nstock had begun to fall in the market. The managing director had sold\\r\\nshares at par which had been at ten premium, and there was evidently\\r\\na scheme on foot to run them down to a discount, and then Mr. Richard\\r\\nTallant would buy up all he could get, for there was not a better\\r\\nconcern in all England than the Meter Works.It was a sore home-thrust this dealing with the Meter shares;\\r\\nbut not the worst blow of all. Certain bill transactions, in which\\r\\nsomething very nearly akin to forgery had been committed, were\\r\\ndisclosed, and Richard Tallant appeared to be a designing sharper\\r\\nof the first class,—one of the leading Stock Exchange conspirators,\\r\\nthrough whose arts so many concerns had been brought to ruin, and from\\r\\nwhich disasters the conspirators had reaped great golden harvests.The merchant was a just man, and he would have every possible proof\\r\\nof his son’s dishonour before he wiped him out for ever. He had ample\\r\\nproof, and he wiped him out accordingly.On the second night after Mrs. Somerton’s confession the lawyer and\\r\\nhis clerk returned to London, and the merchant, having sent to inquire\\r\\nafter the bailiff’s wife, who continued dangerously ill, took a light\\r\\nsupper, retired to his bedroom, and dismissed his man for the night.He took with him the vignette of which Mrs. Somerton had spoken; he\\r\\npulled an arm-chair towards the fire, and sat gazing at the picture\\r\\nlong after everybody was a-bed.He sat there when the last embers in the grate had faded out, and he\\r\\nsat there when the sun rose the next morning—sat there with the picture\\r\\nat his feet—sat there with the red sunlight streaming through the\\r\\nblind, and through apertures in the door of the adjoining room; he sat\\r\\nthere with his head upon his breast, his hands[Pg 32] hanging down, and with his eyes wide open;\\r\\nbut he had been dead for several hours when daylight looked in upon his\\r\\ncorpse.The sunshine was streaming in upon him, we say, and it was so; for\\r\\non that morning the sun had risen with unusual splendour.The east was all ablaze with crimson and golden hues, and from its\\r\\ngorgeous throne the sun shone forth as if with a burning glowing sense\\r\\nof its own grandeur. Troops of radiant beams, bearing commissions\\r\\nfrom the mighty king of day, gleamed above “the high-raised clouds,”\\r\\ndispersed “the morning fogs,” flung wreaths of sunny beauty upon the\\r\\nmantling hills, and glimmered in golden glittering sheen upon the\\r\\nwindows of Barton Hall.Not upon the windows only did the sunbeams fall, we say, but they\\r\\npenetrated the darkened rooms and fell upon the dead man; and here they\\r\\nplayed softly upon his whitened hair, and stole about the room as if\\r\\nthey sought for somebody whom he loved that they might bring them[Pg 33] to his side. Through every\\r\\ncleft and crevice the morning sunbeams streamed; a thousand motes\\r\\nsprang up and danced in the columns of light, as if they mocked the\\r\\ngrave; and a reflection from the merchant’s watch-seals trembled like\\r\\nan active eye upon the wall.Still the merchant slept on in his long, long sleep, until at length\\r\\nthe sun rose higher and higher, paling with his growing radiance the\\r\\ngaudy colours of his throne, and sending forth streams of purer and\\r\\nbrighter light. By-and-by a door was opened in the quiet room, followed\\r\\nby an expression of horror and amazement, and then hurried footsteps\\r\\ncame and went, additional doors were opened and shut, and in a few\\r\\nminutes the household was astir, heavily laden with the morning’s sad\\r\\ndiscovery.All this time Richard Tallant had remained in London; not only\\r\\nremained in London, but had regularly and assiduously attended to his\\r\\nduties at the offices of the Meter Iron Works Company.There had been numerous board meetings, and a half-hearted kind\\r\\nof effort had been made to induce the chairman’s son to retire. Mr.\\r\\nChristopher Tallant had given notice of his resignation; but the board\\r\\ncould not agree upon the question of his successor. Mr. Richard Tallant\\r\\nattended every meeting, and had increased his holding of the company’s\\r\\nstock to a large and important extent.In his father’s absence he had made himself of value to the company;\\r\\nthe run upon their shares had been of brief duration; they had not only\\r\\nspeedily recovered, but had gone up to a heavy premium. Richard Tallant\\r\\nheld his own in the company with a tenacity that surprised everybody\\r\\nconnected with it. Unabashed by the disclosures at the Oriental Bank,\\r\\nundaunted by newspaper attacks, since that notorious meeting when\\r\\nhis father left the chair of the Banking Company, he had been almost\\r\\nubiquitous. He had commenced actions against two newspapers for libel,\\r\\nand had threatened others. Some of his former friends cut him dead in\\r\\nthe Stock Exchange and in the Park; but he defied them all, and was to\\r\\nbe seen as usual at the Corner, on ’Change, and at Westminster.He had written a long letter full of excuses, and promises,\\r\\nand regrets, and justification to his father; but the proud old\\r\\nmerchant did not even acknowledge it. His disgrace was not so much\\r\\nas a nine days’ wonder in the City, and his[Pg 36] continued success was considered, by many,\\r\\nto be a sufficient justification of his conduct.Amidst so many failures, with such numerous instances of sharping,\\r\\nand in the presence of a panic so severe, Richard Tallant’s name soon\\r\\nceased to be canvassed: he paid every call that was made upon him,\\r\\nand he maintained his reputation for wealth. It was known that he had\\r\\nmade enormous sums of money in recent speculations, and that he was\\r\\nfinancially independent. So many men were shaking in their commercial\\r\\nshoes, that few thought themselves able to afford to go out of their\\r\\nway to interfere with a rich man.“What have I done?” Mr. Richard Tallant asked at one of the Meter\\r\\nBoard Meetings, when he was attacked by an old friend of his father.\\r\\n“What have I done more than others have done, and are doing daily?”“You have circulated false reports to damage the credit of good\\r\\nconcerns, in order that you might make money by clever manipulations of\\r\\nshares,” said his opponent.“That is a mere assertion,” was Mr. Richard Tallant’s reply. “Prove\\r\\nit,—prove it, sir; and take this as a caution if you cannot prove it;\\r\\nthere is an offence called slander, which is actionable at law; rely\\r\\nupon it, I will not allow these things to be said with impunity. If I\\r\\nhave made a few hundred thousand pounds by speculation on the Stock\\r\\nExchange, by carefully watching favourable opportunities for buying and\\r\\nselling, it is not my fault that others have lost, and I defy you or\\r\\nany other man to prove that I have done anything without the pale of\\r\\nlegitimate speculation.”“Did you not lend your shares in the Oriental Bank, of which you\\r\\nwere a director, to persons who were bearing the market? Did you not\\r\\nthrow shares upon the market, and did not timid shareholders sell, in\\r\\nconsequence, at a heavy depreciation, and did you not afterwards buy\\r\\nall you could get?”“Suppose I say yes? Had I not a right to deal as I pleased with my\\r\\nown shares? If I did[Pg 38]\\r\\ndepreciate the property of the concern—which I deny—was I not\\r\\ndepreciating my own?”“I will answer it in a court of justice, sir,” said Mr. Richard\\r\\nTallant, striking his fist upon the table. “Do you think I shall permit\\r\\nthe thing to pass over? You shall see how I will put my detractors\\r\\ndown. Do you think I will permit the name of Tallant to be sullied by\\r\\npettifogging brokers in the City?—by twopenny-halfpenny newspapers?\\r\\nDo you think a man with a balance of two hundred thousand pounds at\\r\\nhis bankers in these times is to be put down by reports and rumours,\\r\\nand So-and-so says, and bosh of that character? If you do, you do not\\r\\nknow Richard Tallant. And with regard to the Meter Iron Works, how\\r\\nmany are there who have a larger stake in the prosperity of the[Pg 39] concern than I have myself?\\r\\nWho charges me with neglect of duty?”Mr. Christopher Tallant—poor man—might almost have been proud of the\\r\\nway in which his clever, unscrupulous son asserted himself. One or two\\r\\nof the old men at the board applauded and backed him up. There were\\r\\nmany things in which he had been useful during his father’s absence,\\r\\nand it was chiefly through his influence with a certain railway company\\r\\nthat a recent extensive order for girders had come in from India. Above\\r\\nall, the young fellow had been successful, and there was a manliness\\r\\nin his stand-up fight against all opponents that seemed to carry\\r\\neverything before him.The truth is, on that day when his course of knavery was exposed, he\\r\\nhad sent a trusty messenger to the meeting to report what took place,\\r\\nand when he learnt the result, he quietly shut himself up in his rooms\\r\\nat the West End, and debated with himself upon his line of conduct.\\r\\n“Shall I make a bolt of it?” or “Shall I fight it[Pg 40] out?” These were the two momentous\\r\\nquestions which he put and argued out in a dozen different ways.He knew that his father would never forgive him, and, despite all\\r\\nhis ill conduct, this gave him, a pang or two of regret and sorrow. It\\r\\nwas not until midnight was long past, that he settled his plans: the\\r\\nashes of many cigars lay upon the table, and numerous sheets of paper,\\r\\ncovered with figures, were torn up and scattered about the hearth,\\r\\nbefore the final resolve was made.“I’ll fight it out; I’ll go through with it,” he said at last. “The\\r\\nworld bows down before success, no matter how it is obtained: money\\r\\nopens all doors, whoever knocks. I’ll go in for money—reputation be\\r\\nhanged. Who has got a reputation worth a button in these times? We are\\r\\nin the midst of a panic that will sweep away hundreds of reputations.\\r\\nWhat is the reputation of an honest bankrupt worth? Where is the\\r\\nflyblown reputation that money, and success, and bounce, and swagger\\r\\nwill not cover?”So Mr. Richard Tallant began to “fight it out” next day. He served\\r\\ntwo persons with notices of action for slander, and commenced actions\\r\\nfor libel against two newspapers; he obtained insertion of a paragraph\\r\\nto this effect in a monetary journal; he attended to his duties at the\\r\\nMeter Works with an assiduity that astonished everybody; he wrote that\\r\\nletter to his father, and he fought that battle at the Meter Board\\r\\nwhich we have briefly indicated; he plunged deeper and deeper into\\r\\nspeculations, and he was successful in almost every monetary operation\\r\\nin which he was engaged.Meanwhile things were not quite so pleasant with Mr. Shuffleton\\r\\nGibbs. His overthrow had been completed by poor Dibble’s confession.\\r\\n“Whom the gods devote to destruction, they first deprive of\\r\\nunderstanding.” Mr. Gibbs ought to have had sufficient experience of\\r\\nlife to have known that his passion for revenge was mastering his\\r\\ncunning; he ought to have known enough of character to have seen that\\r\\nDibble would break[Pg 42]\\r\\ndown in the part which he had assigned to him; but Fortune had\\r\\npermitted Gibbs to have his day, as she lets every other dog have his;\\r\\nand she selected her time and instruments accordingly for bringing his\\r\\nday to an end.With justice upon his heels, he had been compelled figuratively to\\r\\nblot himself out; he could not only not sign his name to anything, but\\r\\nhe could not put in a personal appearance anywhere as Mr. Shuffleton\\r\\nGibbs; he had ventured to do a little business in his semi-clerical\\r\\ncapacity, but failure was the result. The transfer of the shares which\\r\\nhe had induced Dibble to take had never been completed, and when Gibbs\\r\\nbenevolently took them back again they were improving; but two days\\r\\nafter Dibble ran away, they went down to a heavy discount. Other things\\r\\nin which he was interested went wrong, the purse that the police held\\r\\nhe could not hope to obtain, and he soon found himself reduced to his\\r\\nlast fifty pounds.Assuming his semi-clerical disguise, he took lodgings in a quiet\\r\\nrespectable street off the Strand, purchased a Newspaper Press\\r\\nDirectory, and wrote out the following attractive advertisements:—Having penned these enticing announcements, Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs\\r\\ncalled upon an engraver and ordered a couple of very business-like\\r\\nheadings to be printed upon unimpeachable letter paper.These he obtained in the course of the next day, and meanwhile he\\r\\nstudied the Press Directory. This valuable work contained an elaborate\\r\\nindex to the newspapers of the United Kingdom, giving their titles\\r\\nin full, the names and addresses of the publishers, with a brief\\r\\ndescription of the towns in which they were published, and the dates\\r\\nof their first publication. It also contained the publishers’ own\\r\\ndescriptions of their newspapers, from which it would seem that each\\r\\npaper was the best medium for giving publicity to announcements of all\\r\\ndescriptions; that several journals in the same town claimed to have\\r\\nthe largest circulation; that they were all leading papers, first-class\\r\\nfamily papers, influential papers; some were the oldest Liberal papers,\\r\\nsome the oldest Conservative papers, many the only Penny papers in the\\r\\ndistrict.Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs made a careful list of these numerous journals,\\r\\nselecting largely from among the newest penny papers, carefully jotting\\r\\ndown all the dailies, and judiciously balancing the old weeklies,\\r\\nin the manufacturing districts, against those claiming to be more\\r\\nespecially county papers.A printer in Shoreditch struck off for him a number of copies of his\\r\\nadvertisements, and when all was prepared he commenced to write his\\r\\norders for their publication. With these orders he enclosed packets\\r\\nof postage stamps, varying in value from sixpence to five and six\\r\\nshillings. Nearly one hundred and fifty went away without any stamps\\r\\nat all, the writer requesting a bill for the amount to be sent off\\r\\nwhen the advertisement had appeared, with a quotation for thirteen,\\r\\ntwenty-six, and fifty-two insertions. These were chiefly posted to the\\r\\npenny district papers and to those most recently established.These missives duly passed through the post-office, and were opened\\r\\nby newspaper publishers,[Pg\\r\\n46] clerks, proprietors, and editors, the next day, in all\\r\\nparts of England. Some of them were opened in bright, well-furnished\\r\\ncounting-houses; many in dingy little back rooms; others were carried\\r\\nup to private houses, where proprietors and editors read their letters\\r\\nbefore business hours in the morning.If you could have witnessed the varied treatment which these letters\\r\\nof Mr. Gibbs, alias Marfleeting, alias Cavendish,\\r\\nreceived, you would have been highly entertained. Some gentlemen who\\r\\nopened the letters smiled contemptuously, said, “Indeed,” and returned\\r\\nstamps and order; others who were not favoured with stamps tossed the\\r\\nletters into waste-paper baskets; some said, “Bah!” and tore the things\\r\\nup. In many cases, however, the stamps were passed to credit, and the\\r\\nadvertisement ordered for insertion in the ordinary course of business;\\r\\nand amongst the new and cheap district papers, half printed in London\\r\\nand otherwise, the order unaccompanied by stamps was duly obeyed, and a\\r\\nprice gravely[Pg 47] quoted\\r\\nfor thirteen, twenty-six, and fifty-two insertions, with discount\\r\\ncarefully mentioned for pre-payment.In a few days, therefore, Mr. Gibbs’ advertising baits were duly\\r\\ndisplayed in numerous journals. Several leading papers had at various\\r\\ntimes cautioned their readers against this class of announcement; still\\r\\nadvertisements of the kind occasionally obtained insertion in the\\r\\nordinary course of business. Thus the two I have mentioned had places\\r\\nin many newspapers, and in less than a week Mr. Gibbs found quite a\\r\\nheap of letters waiting for him at the little coffee-house, No. 6,\\r\\nBurkit-street, City, addressed to Henry Cavendish, Esq. To the first\\r\\nbatch of these he replied, stating that applications were so numerous\\r\\nthe materials could not be manufactured fast enough, but that they\\r\\nshould be sent off in a few days. He had so many communications at\\r\\nGreat Charlton-street, that he was compelled to have a printed form of\\r\\nreply, and in this he enclosed another form, which the applicant was\\r\\nrequested[Pg 48] to fill\\r\\nup and forward by return, with five shillings for inquiry fees and\\r\\nfive shillings for preliminary fees, which would be returned in case\\r\\nthe loan were not granted. “An agent will call upon you personally\\r\\nin the course of three or four days with the cash, Mr. Marfleeting\\r\\nhaving several agents travelling through the provinces, as he finds\\r\\nthis mode of doing business safer, more expeditious and private, than\\r\\nnegotiations by letter.”Hundreds of clients responded to Mr. Marfleeting’s reply, and scores\\r\\nof ladies continued to address private notes to Henry Cavendish,\\r\\nEsq.What pinching and starving, and need, and keeping up appearances,\\r\\nall these letters represented! What stories they indicated! What fears\\r\\nof bankruptcy, what hopes deferred, what cheerless hearths, what\\r\\nbattles for life, what misery! Small tradesmen with bills of exchange\\r\\ncoming due; shopkeepers pressed for rent; clerks who had overrun the\\r\\nconstable; mechanics with extravagant wives; men of small means who\\r\\nhad[Pg 49] speculated, and\\r\\nhad to meet unexpected calls upon shares which were to have made their\\r\\nfortune, and would prove their ruin—drowning men in the financial\\r\\nsea—these were they who caught at the monetary straws of Marfleeting.\\r\\nWidows with small allowances hardly enough to keep body and soul\\r\\ntogether, widows who lived on lodgers, widows keeping up appearances,\\r\\nspinsters with precarious incomes, daily governesses, eldest daughters\\r\\nin large families, mothers with invalid and drunken husbands—these were\\r\\nforemost in the crowd who sent their money to Henry Cavendish, Esq.,\\r\\nand saw in the future competency and comfort by means of his glorious\\r\\ninvention; and some of these poor people went down upon their knees at\\r\\nnight and prayed that God would prosper their labours and so extend the\\r\\nuse of this new invention, that it should be a blessing to them and to\\r\\nothers who might be in necessity and tribulation.The news of Mr. Christopher Tallant’s death brought down his son by\\r\\nthe earliest train. He hired a fly at the Avonworth Hotel, and reached\\r\\nBarton in the afternoon of a cold November day.He felt that his conduct had hurried on the sad event which brought\\r\\nhim once again in the vale of Avonworth. The telegram which Phœbe\\r\\nhad considered it her duty to send to him, had for a moment struck him\\r\\ndown like a blow. But of late he had so thoroughly schooled himself to\\r\\nhis fate, had so trampled upon conscience and feeling, that he soon\\r\\nrecovered his former coolness.The thought occurred to him whether any change had been made in\\r\\nthe will which he knew had been signed in his favour. Was this fine\\r\\nestate his own? Were those fields and woods his? Had that property in\\r\\nYorkshire, those splendid farms on the wolds, reverted to the only son\\r\\nof Christopher Tallant? How much had the old man left?It occurred to him that his father might have changed his will,\\r\\nindeed he had every reason to believe that such had been his intention.\\r\\nBut he would not let this more than probable contingency have a\\r\\nsettled place in his thoughts; for the desire of possession came upon\\r\\nhim as the country conveyance dragged slowly along through the fine\\r\\nwell-timbered park which had been fields within his own memory—fields\\r\\novergrown with hedges and elm trees, and gorse and brushwood.The blinds were down in all parts of the house, and Chester, the\\r\\nlate Mr. Tallant’s man, opened the hall door slowly, and took Mr.\\r\\nRichard’s coat and hat without a smile or a word.Richard Tallant had qualms of conscience as he entered the familiar\\r\\nhall; a sense of fear came over him; he remembered all of a sudden\\r\\nthe thousand acts of parental kindness and liberality that had been\\r\\nlavished upon him. Conscience would not let him forget all this, and\\r\\nhonour reminded him how low he had fallen; so he spoke loud and gave\\r\\ncommands, and assumed a tone of authority.Phœbe soon came, pale and careworn, and with the tears in her\\r\\neyes, she submitted to be kissed, and she kissed Richard in return, but\\r\\nshe said not a word.“Don’t ask me for explanations—Chester will[Pg 53] tell you about it,” she replied, softly and\\r\\ntenderly.“Will you come up-stairs and see him?” Phœbe asked, putting\\r\\nher hand upon his arm, and wondering for a moment at his changed\\r\\nappearance.The son paused, with the sherry partly raised to his lips, and\\r\\nreplaced the full glass upon the table.“No,” he said at length with a great effort, and withdrawing his arm\\r\\nfrom her gentle touch, “No; by-and-by.”He dare not look upon that cold white face;[Pg 54] for whilst Phœbe was talking,\\r\\nconscience gripped him savagely and made him a coward. He could look\\r\\nat nothing but the floor, and there the very boards seemed to twit him\\r\\nwith his infamy and ingratitude.His only relief was to rush to the bell and ring for Chester, and\\r\\nwhen he came, Phœbe glided out of the room to her chamber.It had been a particularly sad and anxious time for Phœbe, and\\r\\nshe appeared to stand alone in her sorrow. Arthur Phillips, from whom\\r\\nshe had been wont occasionally to ask advice upon minor things, and\\r\\nin whose talk about art she had been so often engrossed, had not been\\r\\nnear the house for months; the change which had recently come over Amy,\\r\\nRichard Tallant’s estrangement from her father, that father’s sorrow\\r\\nand death, all seemed to come upon her, blow after blow, and to leave\\r\\nher without one sympathising soul to whom she could look for a ray of\\r\\nhope and comfort.What had become of Arthur Phillips? She[Pg 55] had wondered a hundred times. His absence\\r\\nhad been like something gone out of her life—like some domestic\\r\\naffliction. Her palette and canvas had lost all interest for her now.\\r\\nThey had reminded her too much of her deep and secret sympathy in all\\r\\nthat concerned him. She did not confess to herself that she loved him,\\r\\nand, truth to tell, she hardly knew that she did love him; but his\\r\\nabsence was a hardship. His quiet homage was something that satisfied\\r\\nher; his warm enthusiasm about the beautiful and the true; his stories\\r\\nof painters who had won their way to fame and fortune by dint of their\\r\\ninborn genius and industry; his judgment about books; his criticisms\\r\\non poetry; his compliments when she had been more than ordinarily\\r\\nsuccessful in some touch of colour: all this had been part of her\\r\\nexistence, and with Arthur’s absence had come all the manifold troubles\\r\\nwhich had afflicted her young life, clouded her hopes, and covered her\\r\\nwith a sorrow too deep for words.And what had Arthur Phillips been doing[Pg 56] all this time? Painting that grand picture\\r\\nwhich he said he would paint when last we heard him speak some months\\r\\nago.The commercial panic had sorely afflicted a special local\\r\\nmanufacture in which a large number of men and women had been employed\\r\\nat Severntown. As Arthur was returning home, on the day following\\r\\nthat evening when we saw him at work in the fields, he met a number\\r\\nof operatives thrown out of work, who with no chance of the factory\\r\\nbeing re-opened, had set out “on tramp.” Arthur questioned them, and\\r\\nfound that on the next morning nearly a hundred families were going to\\r\\nleave by train for Liverpool on their way to Australia. Subscriptions\\r\\nhad been entered into to promote a scheme of emigration started by the\\r\\noperatives themselves, and this first exodus would take place the next\\r\\nmorning.Few of us but will remember, at some period of life, standing in a\\r\\nrailway station, and watching the departure of a train containing[Pg 57] some one the taking leave\\r\\nof whom excited all those human sensibilities which find vent inHere was Arthur’s inspiration; he read the simple thoughts and the\\r\\nattendant quotation in a newspaper. The parting with Lionel Hammerton\\r\\nhad prepared him for it, and all[Pg\\r\\n59] of a sudden he said to himself, “This shall be my great\\r\\npicture, and I will call it ‘Seeking New Homes.’”He was at the railway station with the dawn of the next day, busily\\r\\nengaged sketching various points.By-and-by, as the emigrants began to arrive, he made hurried\\r\\nsketches of faces and costumes, and in the course of an hour or two he\\r\\nstood there, fully realising all the inspiration which had come upon\\r\\nhim in the highway: his broad elastic sympathies had been excited to\\r\\nthe full, and he stood watching the train that had gone, almost with\\r\\ntears in his eyes—stood amidst numerous little affecting groups of men\\r\\nand women, and shared their sorrows.The train which had gone was gaily decorated with ribbons, and\\r\\nhad quite a holiday appearance; the passengers had been singing some\\r\\nwell-known ballad; and the friends left behind had cheered them.\\r\\nPeople must do something to keep down that choking sensation[Pg 60] which the strongest have\\r\\nfelt at parting, and songs and cheering were capital resources for\\r\\n“driving dull care away,” on the occasion of a hundred poor families\\r\\nseeking the means of existence in a distant land.Great battles have no more moving incidents than those social\\r\\ncatastrophes which fall now and then upon manufacturing districts,\\r\\nbringing all the ills of poverty and starvation, and forced idleness\\r\\nupon poor, uneducated, improvident people. At these times instances\\r\\nenough of self-sacrifice and love crop up amongst them to make up for\\r\\nall the stories of selfishness and brutality that come out in their\\r\\nprosperity.Arthur Phillips did not fail to take in the whole of that scene at\\r\\nthe railway station: he did not forget those men and women with the\\r\\nblanched cheeks and tearful eyes. To them the parting could not be\\r\\notherwise than painfully significant. It was a separation more fruitful\\r\\nof grief and apprehension than the common parting of friends. It was a\\r\\nforced[Pg 61] exile, which\\r\\nthose left behind might soon be compelled to follow—a flying from one\\r\\nill to another, between which those left behind stood wavering, with\\r\\nlittle ones around them looking up for comfort and finding none.The artist bent himself to his work from that very day. At night he\\r\\ncompleted his various sketches and studied his subject, and in the day\\r\\nhe painted from early morn to evening—painted for very life—painted\\r\\nfor love, and money, and fame, and sympathy. It was striking out in a\\r\\nnew line, but he had no fear of the result. In less than a month the\\r\\npicture began to assume form and character; never had artist worked\\r\\nwith more rapidity and with more earnestness of purpose. The work had\\r\\nnever flagged—it had gone on day by day without interruption or change\\r\\nof plan. The subject was so thoroughly mapped out in the artist’s mind,\\r\\nthat time alone stood between him and its completion. The figures\\r\\nwere few but full of character, and the last touch was given[Pg 62] to the whole on that\\r\\nmorning when Mr. Tallant died.The story was wonderfully told: the picture was a poem on\\r\\ncanvas—full of human nature, brimming over with sympathy. As a work of\\r\\nart—for conception, drawing, perspective colour, it was truly a grand\\r\\npicture; and Arthur felt his success as he sat before it that morning,\\r\\nwhen the sun was shining upon the dead man at Barton Hall.On the next day, before the picture could hardly be said to be dry,\\r\\nArthur had it packed, and he posted with it to London, where he had\\r\\narranged for it to be hung at a winter exhibition. Josephs the dealer,\\r\\nwho had previously purchased everything Mr. Phillips chose to let him\\r\\nhave, had heard some whisper about it, and had visited Arthur the week\\r\\nbefore; but the artist could not be prevailed upon to show the picture\\r\\nto anybody but his old housekeeper who had nursed him when he was a\\r\\nboy, and she had sat before it and cried and sobbed over it almost\\r\\nheart-broken:[Pg 63] then\\r\\nArthur felt that he had painted a great picture, and he knew it when\\r\\nhe unveiled it again in that long room in Suffolk-street, Pall Mall,\\r\\nbefore a small critical company.In a few hours “Seeking New Homes” was talked of in artistic and\\r\\nliterary society all over London, and when everybody was asking\\r\\neverybody else if they had seen the new picture, Arthur Phillips drove\\r\\ndown to Paddington and took a ticket for Avonworth.The success of Christabel, “the mysterious lady,” in some new\\r\\nbusiness at the Severntown races, together with the high appreciation\\r\\nwhich the working classes exhibited of the tricks of “Momus” and\\r\\nhis master, induced the showman to make a considerable stay at\\r\\nSeverntown.Mr. Henry Bilks, “the only living skeleton extant,” had also made\\r\\novertures to Mr. Martin to join him in a permanent winter exhibition,\\r\\nand, so strangely does one thing influence another, that the\\r\\nadvertisement of Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs played its part in the scheme.The Temple of Magic had already been removed to the Blue Post’s\\r\\nYard, where “the riders” and[Pg\\r\\n65] other companies of public entertainers usually took their\\r\\nstand; the public had already been addressed in grandiloquent terms,\\r\\nin very grey ink, on very thin paper; and Mr. Dibble had solemnly done\\r\\nduty “on the outside” for many nights, when Mr. Bilks drove to the\\r\\nside-door, (“private entrance, ladies and gentlemen, at the side, price\\r\\nthree pence!”), and without further ado went behind the magic curtain,\\r\\nand offered to join the wizard for the winter season, if the wizard\\r\\nwould take a shop in some public street, advertise the exhibition, and\\r\\nconduct it upon something like high-class principles.The “living skeleton” had left with the showman copies of various\\r\\ntestimonials, and a copy of the Slumkey Guardian. It was in\\r\\nthis latter journal that Martin had spelled out the Loan Office\\r\\nadvertisement, whereupon he dictated to Dibble the terms of a letter\\r\\nwhich should be sent to James Marfleeting, Esq.It was a strangely quaint and ungrammatical letter this, penned by\\r\\nThomas Dibble. It set forth,[Pg\\r\\n66] in big straggling letters, that the writer was the\\r\\nproprietor of an exhibition of considerable fame in the provinces;\\r\\nthat he was anxious to add thereto additional attractions, and make it\\r\\na permanent thing for the winter at the important city of Severntown,\\r\\nwhere it had recently attained to a pitch of great celebrity.The writer required a loan of one hundred pounds for six months,\\r\\nre-payable by instalments, and he was prepared to give his bond for the\\r\\namount, together with security upon his properties.“Indeed,” said Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs, who was just preparing to\\r\\nremove his quarters from the street off the Strand. “Indeed! Thomas\\r\\nDibble, by all that is wonderful! I never forget handwriting, and I\\r\\nshall never forget Master Dibble’s above everybody else’s. Surely\\r\\nhe has not turned showman? No; he is the exhibitor’s fag, his\\r\\nman-of-all-work, and he has written this letter from dictation. I will\\r\\nreply by-and-by. Meanwhile, I must see what there is to be made out\\r\\nof this[Pg 67] with Mrs.\\r\\nDibble. I fancy the old girl would give something to know where her\\r\\nfaithless Tommy is.”Thus soliloquised Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs, whilst he packed up sundry\\r\\nletters and papers, and prepared to change his residence.Some of his correspondents were beginning to be tiresome; they had\\r\\ncommenced to require explanations of the continued delay; and the women\\r\\nwho had written to the Coffee House in the City, were appealing in\\r\\nheart-breaking terms for the promised materials, or the return of their\\r\\nmoney.“It is getting hot,” the ex-swell went on. “I can’t stand these\\r\\npathetic epistles; they hurt my feelings. Poor creatures! They\\r\\nwould surely be satisfied if they knew that they were contributing\\r\\nto maintain the faded splendours—ah! of a buck out of luck. That’s\\r\\nrhyme—’gad, bless my soul! who would have thought that I should burst\\r\\nout into rhyme? I am very sorry, ladies, that I cannot afford to\\r\\nforward the materials in question, nor the trifling sums which you\\r\\nhave—haw—entrusted[Pg 68]\\r\\nto my care. And, messieurs, les pauvres gentilhommes, and you,\\r\\nye wretched traders, who get into debt beyond your means of payment,\\r\\nI will make further inquiries into your cases. Meanwhile I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for the fees which you have forwarded so promptly.”The next day a detective officer inquired at No. 3, Great Charlton\\r\\nStreet, Strand, for James Marfleeting, Esq.; but that gentleman had\\r\\nleft the house without giving the landlady warning, or paying for the\\r\\nlast week’s rent.Shortly afterwards, in the garb of a “Mossoo” of the Leech cut, and\\r\\nwith a heavy black moustache, Mr. Gibbs called at Mrs. Dibble’s. He\\r\\nfound that lady in a very melancholy state of mind, and considerably\\r\\nthinner than when we last saw her.With a strong French accent he asked Mrs. Dibble if her husband had\\r\\nrun away, and if his name was Thomas.“Yeth, thir,” was Mrs. Dibble’s reply. “It ith with feelings of\\r\\nthorrow and shame—though why[Pg\\r\\n69] I should have such feelings, ith not my fault or deserth—it\\r\\nith, however, with these feelings that I thay yeth to you, and having\\r\\nhad a boarding-school education ath a girl, and been brought up in the\\r\\nhighest spear of society, it ith a degradation which I feel to the\\r\\ncore.”“Ah, madame, dat is bad, dat is very bad; for it is goot to have\\r\\neducation,—and why shall your husband leave you?”Mr. Gibbs shrugged his shoulders and raised his hands as he\\r\\nspoke, and Mrs. Dibble sighed and shook her little stumpy curls\\r\\nsympathetically.“It ith a long story, which I am not inclined to go into\\r\\nunnecessarily,” said Mrs. Dibble, “and there are griefs which are not\\r\\nimproved by being talked about. Ath a busineth woman, and one who wath\\r\\nthe daughter of a builder that erected hundreds of houses and public\\r\\ninthitutions, the specifications of which I have written out many a\\r\\ntime,—ath a busineth woman, I would athk what your busineth ith with\\r\\nme? and then we can go on.”“If I shall pring you to vere your husband shall be, is he of—ah!\\r\\nvat sall I say?—is he of dat value to you for vich you sall pay mine\\r\\nfees, vich is out of mine pocket?”Mrs. Dibble did not reply, but proceeded to fasten her dress behind,\\r\\nwhich required a considerable effort.“You vill be surprised at vat I ask, but dat vill disappear ven I tell\\r\\nyou I am attached to a Private Inquiry Office, vich is on de French\\r\\nplan, and dat I am in de detective line à la Française, and I\\r\\ncan restore to your arm de husband of your heart.”Mrs. Dibble demurred to this for some time, and argued the point in\\r\\na dozen ways; but Mr. Gibbs was not to be moved. Finally Mrs. Dibble\\r\\ngave him three five-pound notes, and in return received his address at\\r\\n“The Temple of Magic, Blue Posts Inn yard, Severntown.”It was rather a courageous thing on the part of Mr. Gibbs to visit\\r\\nMrs. Dibble; but he no doubt felt perfectly secure in his disguise.He visited her at a time when he calculated that her lodgers would\\r\\nbe away at their several places of business; for Paul Somerton might\\r\\nhave been more penetrating than Mrs. Dibble.Paul still lodged with Mrs. Dibble, and was rapidly making his way\\r\\nto a respectable position through the kind introductions of his patron,\\r\\nMr. Williamson.His unsophisticated manners, his honesty, his thoroughly English\\r\\ncharacteristics, his manliness, and his intelligent face had quite won\\r\\nMr.[Pg 72] Williamson’s\\r\\nheart, and he frequently invited Paul to sup with him at his chambers\\r\\nin the Temple.A quiet cozy little room, up several narrow flights of stairs—a snug\\r\\nlittle room, though slightly fusty—with two sides occupied by law books\\r\\nbound in calf. There were sundry maps and old engravings hung here and\\r\\nthere; a bust of a Chancery judge, a ditto of Shakspeare; a coal-box, a\\r\\ncouple of easy chairs, a table littered with papers, and a mantel-piece\\r\\ncovered with visiting and invitation cards.When the sombre curtains were drawn, and that mysterious old woman,\\r\\nwho turned up from some dark corner outside the door, was permitted\\r\\nto retire for the night, and Mr. Williamson produced the sugar and\\r\\nlemons and whisky—when the kettle was singing on the fire—then indeed\\r\\nwas that little room snug, and cosy, and everything else that is\\r\\ncomfortable.“It is pleasant to talk to a simple-hearted young fellow like you,”\\r\\nsaid Mr. Williamson[Pg 73]\\r\\nupon one of those evenings prior to the sudden death of Mr. Tallant.“You think an all-wise Providence conferred a great boon upon you\\r\\nwhen He called you into existence, and all that sort of thing?”“You would not, could you now select, be blotted out for ever, and\\r\\nhave all your chances or hopes of a future annihilated?”“Happy youth,” said Mr. Williamson, smoking and blowing the smoke up\\r\\namongst his books bound in calf.“Well, not particularly happy that I know of,” said Paul; “but still,\\r\\nwith all respect to you, I thank God I am happier than some people.”“And you don’t think the Bible is Hebrew mythology? In fact, you are a\\r\\nvirtuous, good boy. You think it’s a good thing, too, to have been born\\r\\nan Englishman, and that we are better and braver than other people, and\\r\\nall that stuff?”“Very well; I shall not try to influence your\\r\\northodox views, and I will endeavour to promote your temporal\\r\\nprosperity. You like the Pyrotechnic office, and you think you\\r\\nwill get on?”“I suppose, like most fellows connected with newspapers in any way,\\r\\nyou would rather be on the literary staff? You would like to be giving\\r\\nforth your own opinions, and see them printed in long columns of leaded\\r\\ntype?” said the barrister, who was evidently highly amused with Paul,\\r\\nwhom he seemed to regard as an agreeable study.“There’s nothing in it, my boy—nothing at all. At first there is a\\r\\nkind of satisfaction about the thing; but it all arises from conceit:\\r\\nit is all vanity and vexation of spirit, as the Preacher says. It is\\r\\nall very well if you can obtain one or two comfortable engagements,\\r\\nwith permission to write pretty well what you please; and when you can\\r\\ncombine literature, as I do, with another distinguished profession.”Mr. Williamson smiled at this bit of quiet waggery of his own,\\r\\nseeing that he had never yet had more than a single client.“If one has not many clients, however,” he went on, as if answering\\r\\nhis own protest against that small boast about combining two\\r\\nprofessions, “the law is a distinguished profession after all: makes\\r\\none a gentleman by Act of Parliament, you know, Paul.”“There is an offshoot of the legal profession, a sort of\\r\\nJackall-byeway, along which a large quantity of grist comes to the\\r\\nlegal mill—I mean the police. The higher branches of that craft present\\r\\nmany features of interest—the detective feature in particular,” the\\r\\nbarrister went on. “I have been studying it a little lately, in the\\r\\ninterest of your friend Gibbs; the police seem to have given the fellow\\r\\nup altogether.”As they were talking, two literary friends dropped in, and the\\r\\nconversation was changed to a gossip about books, and plays, and\\r\\npictures—“Seeking New Homes” was a leading topic. One of the strangers\\r\\nsaid the town was mad about it, and after all it was just simply a\\r\\nsensational thing—a dramatic bit that would engrave well and be popular\\r\\nin country districts. His companion did not agree with this criticism,\\r\\nbut spoke of the picture as a work of really high art—a poem on canvas,\\r\\nwonderfully well painted.And so the time wore on, and by degrees[Pg 77] the barrister’s room was filled with smoke,\\r\\nand Paul at length bade his friend and patron good-night, shook hands\\r\\nwith the visitors, and departed.“You are a queer fellow, Williamson,” said one of the new comers as\\r\\nPaul left the room and commenced blundering his way down-stairs.“Yes, that is the young fellow,” said the barrister; “he is quite a\\r\\nstudy of English innocence and honesty, and I am going to be useful to\\r\\nhim. His sister is a splendid creature; but, somehow or other, he tells\\r\\nme now that it is discovered she is not his sister, but the daughter of\\r\\na very wealthy gentleman. There is something exceedingly interesting\\r\\nin the whole family: his only brother went to sea at fifteen, and has\\r\\nnever since been heard of.”“Williamson’s going to write a sensation romance,” said one\\r\\nfriend to the other, in a loud ironical aside; “and here are his\\r\\nmaterials.”“I am certainly studying the young fellow,” said Williamson,\\r\\nquietly. “A bit of genuine honesty of thought and feeling and\\r\\nexpression, though it be not coupled with the highest order of\\r\\neducation, is very refreshing to contemplate in these times, and\\r\\nespecially when one is connected with professional critics.”Williamson smiled quietly at the gentleman who had spoken adversely\\r\\nof “Seeking New Homes,” and the critic laughed good-humouredly in\\r\\nreturn, tapped his hand upon the table, and said:—“Ah, well! wait until your sensation novel appears, Williamson, and\\r\\nI’ll take it out of you, my friend.”And then they all laughed; for who that knew Williamson’s lazy habit\\r\\nwould ever expect him to write a story of eight or nine hundred pages?\\r\\nAnd if he did, who amongst his personal friends, that were critics,\\r\\nwould have said an unkind word of him or his work?He was a big-hearted, generous pet amongst[Pg 79] all the men, this same journalistic\\r\\nbarrister, and known amongst them all as “The Philanthropist.” It was a\\r\\nhappy thing for Paul that the barrister was on a mission of benevolence\\r\\nat the Police Court on that memorable morning when he stood at the\\r\\ndock, and equally unlucky for Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs.It did not need much persuasion to induce Paul to accompany Mrs.\\r\\nDibble on her projected journey to Severntown. He easily obtained\\r\\npermission to leave the Pyrotechnic for a couple of days, and\\r\\non a miserable December morning they arrived at the famous city of\\r\\nSeverntown—famous in the present day for many things: for its noble\\r\\ncathedral, as we have already intimated; for its grand old river, its\\r\\nclean broad streets and its narrow dirty ones, through which a king was\\r\\nchased by Cromwellian troops.A city to be proud of this same Severntown—to be proud of for\\r\\nits historical associations, its eminent men and women, ancient\\r\\nand modern; a[Pg 81]\\r\\ncity surrounded by a beautiful country, studded with the seats of\\r\\nnoblemen, whose four-in-hands are still oftentimes seen rattling over\\r\\nthe white road-ways; a city that was wont, in ancient days, to have\\r\\nunusually fierce election contests, and which is now settling down\\r\\ninto moderate opinions, and throwing its latent political fire into\\r\\ncommercial enterprise. It manufactures all kinds of things which have\\r\\na strange sound when mentioned together, such as steam-engines and\\r\\nporcelain, pickles and horse-hair, carriages and sauce, fire-grates and\\r\\nshirt-studs, gin and boots, and other machines, condiments, ornaments,\\r\\nspirits, and wearing apparel. It has quarrels about sewers, the price\\r\\nof gas, and the state of the streets, like all other provincial towns,\\r\\nand a long dirty road to the railway station.There was a row of six cabs and an antique sort of bus at the\\r\\nrailway station, and several ragged youngsters who offered to carry the\\r\\ntravellers’ carpet-bags.Close by the station Paul detected a comfortable-looking[Pg 82] inn, into which inn he and\\r\\nMrs. Dibble directed their steps—not that Mrs. Dibble approved of inns,\\r\\nfor she did not, as she told Paul over and over again, although in the\\r\\ncourse of business her father had been called upon to build several\\r\\nestablishments of the kind, and the specifications had gone through her\\r\\nhands; but no doubt they were necessary sometimes, and she thought they\\r\\nwere justified in taking up their abode at one, and having something\\r\\nhot and some tea at this inn in particular, and on the shortest\\r\\npossible notice; so Paul ordered the refreshment whilst Mrs. Dibble,\\r\\nstruggling under a load of shawls and comforters and rugs, was shown to\\r\\nher room.If Mrs. Dibble had had the smallest compunction about entering\\r\\nthe railway tavern, she had no hesitation about the chops and the\\r\\ntea and the muffins and watercress, which she was liberal enough to\\r\\ncommend, giving very practical illustrations of her approval of the\\r\\nfare, and all the time talking of her poor appetite, and telling Paul\\r\\nhow[Pg 83] seriously Mr.\\r\\nDibble’s conduct had injured her health. She became so confidential\\r\\nupon this point, and at length felt herself so much at home that she\\r\\npermitted the hooks-and-eyes nearest her chin to disengage themselves,\\r\\nand insisted upon Paul joining her in just sixpenny-worth of\\r\\nspirits-and-water before they ventured out in the cold to discover the\\r\\nyard by the Blue Posts Inn.The spirits-and-water made them both very warm and comfortable, and\\r\\nPaul at length offered his arm to his companion, and away they started\\r\\ntowards the point indicated.It was a damp, drizzling night, and there were treacherous holes\\r\\nhere and there in the path which Mrs. Dibble assured Paul were in the\\r\\nhighest degree uncomfortable. She was sure her stockings would be that\\r\\nsplashed that they would not be fit to be seen.Severntown did not look at all inviting in the hazy light of the\\r\\nDecember gas; but Paul knew the place, and redeemed its character\\r\\nto some extent by telling Mrs. Dibble that they were in[Pg 84] the back slums, which she\\r\\nsaid she could readily understand.Through dirty streets, with one or two bridges over black, murky\\r\\nwater; past lazy carts and rumbling cabs splashing through the mud;\\r\\nby narrow footways, which were sometimes no footways at all; it was\\r\\ncertainly no pleasant route to the Blue Posts. At length, however,\\r\\nthey came to a fine, open, well-lit street, and after walking a short\\r\\ndistance in this brighter locality, they turned sharply round into a\\r\\nnarrow passage, and then emerged into an open, muddy square.Here was situated Digby Martin’s Temple of Magic, and Mrs. Dibble\\r\\nand Paul stopped to study the scene before them.About two hundred persons of all ages were crowded in front of a\\r\\nshow of the old-fashioned traditional stamp. A small platform, which\\r\\nwas ascended by broad wooden steps, was surmounted with a very florid\\r\\npainting of a character that evidently proved highly attractive to\\r\\nthe audience. A lady in a low dress, with a wonderful necklace[Pg 85] round her neck, and very\\r\\ndazzling bracelets upon her arms, was represented in the attitude of\\r\\npointing at a box, from which two pigeons were flying, in the direction\\r\\nof an auditory consisting of a king and numerous officers in the army.\\r\\nSeveral rabbits were quietly peeping out of a saucepan placed upon\\r\\na fire, a shower of cards and fruit and watches was falling from an\\r\\ninverted hat, and in the background were sundry mystic signs beneath a\\r\\nblazing sun.The companion picture was, if possible, of a higher order of merit,\\r\\nthough of a simpler character. It represented the young lady in the low\\r\\ndress crouching beneath a capacious basket, and it also represented\\r\\nthe same basket being raised by a man with black moustachios, who\\r\\nsignificantly pointed to the vacant space beneath; underneath was\\r\\nwritten in big letters, “The Famous Basket Trick.”Hung at various points in frames of various character, was\\r\\nrepresented a tremendous dog going through an exciting and varied\\r\\nperformance.[Pg 86] Here he\\r\\nstood upon his head, there he fired off a pistol; in another place\\r\\nhe was engaged in a sort of pugilistic encounter with a professional\\r\\nbruiser, and around the frames which contained these pictorial\\r\\nattractions was printed, “The celebrated dog ‘Momus’ in a round of\\r\\nfavourite and world-renowned characters.”The proprietor of the caravan had had a great argument with the\\r\\nartist who executed these latter works upon the propriety of calling\\r\\nMomus a “dogess,” which the showman thought would be sure to “draw;”\\r\\nbut the artist had gravely assured him that such a title would not come\\r\\nwithin the rules of strict art, however grammatical it might be, and\\r\\nthis settled the question at once.Upon the platform a young lady, in pink muslin and spangles and\\r\\nfleshings, with a crown upon her head, and many rows of curious beads\\r\\naround her neck, was marching solemnly to and fro, to an old ballad\\r\\nmelody which a fellow in a bowler hat was twisting out of an organ, and\\r\\nto which he was keeping time on a very hard drum.Strutting backwards and forwards also, sometimes before the young\\r\\nlady in muslin and sometimes behind her, was a gaunt, greyish-looking\\r\\ndog, dressed up in military costume, and occasionally stopping to go\\r\\nthrough little bits of military exercise.Three flaming and spluttering naphtha lamps cast a flickering\\r\\nuncertain light upon the singular scene, making the surrounding\\r\\ndarkness all the darker.By-and-by the man at the organ laid down his drum-stick, and, taking\\r\\nup a long whip, came to the top of the ladder, and after cracking the\\r\\nwhip in a grave, solemn sort of fashion, he struck the spangled lady in\\r\\nthe picture, and said in a loud voice,—“Now, ladies and gentlemen, be in time, be in time! there be no\\r\\ntime to lose! we be just a-goin’ to commence! The mysterious Lady of\\r\\nthe North and the hemmernent Wizard—the greatest wonder in Europe! The\\r\\nwonderful basket trick, or the mysterious secret, is pronounced by all\\r\\nwho ’ave seen it to be the greatest feat——”There is no knowing how much more the speaker would have said\\r\\nconcerning the marvels of this famous exhibition had he not been\\r\\ninterrupted by three terrible screams, one following the other in rapid\\r\\nand startling succession, and uttered by a stout woman in the crowd,\\r\\nwho was looking up at Dibble and fighting the air above her head with\\r\\ntwo very short arms in a most alarming manner.“Oh, here’s a lark—the old woman’s drunk,” said a boy, throwing his\\r\\nhat up into the drizzly, mizzly air.“Let me alone—let me alone!” at length Mrs. Dibble exclaimed,\\r\\nbeating her way through the crowd, and mounting the Temple steps amidst\\r\\nroars of laughter and shouts of applause.The gentleman with the whip became suddenly very much agitated, and\\r\\nwhen he saw the woman approaching the platform, he fairly turned round\\r\\nand bolted into the Temple.Seeing this, a crowd rushed up after the old lady; but “Christabel,”\\r\\nthe showman’s daughter, seized the whip which Dibble had dropped,\\r\\ncalled “Father” lustily, and began to defend the pass.Digby Martin appeared in his shirt-sleeves, and in an instant struck\\r\\na splendid fighting attitude in face of the intruders, which caused a\\r\\nnumber of them to change their minds, and produced from others sundry\\r\\ncoppers which entitled them to admission.When they were inside, Paul amongst the number, they saw a gorgeous\\r\\narray of tinselled cups and vases arranged on a black velvet dais, with\\r\\na shimmering wheel revolving in the background, Mr. Dibble leaning over\\r\\nthe stout woman and calling frantically for somebody to bring him some\\r\\nwater, whilst the renowned Momus was jumping round the pair and barking\\r\\nin a most unmilitary fashion.Before there was time for Dibble’s calls for water to receive any\\r\\nattention, Mrs. Dibble looked up and requested Thomas, “dear Thomas,”\\r\\nto[Pg 90] conduct her to a\\r\\nprivate room, at which there were renewed shouts of laughter.Paul Somerton was fain to keep in the background, for he was getting\\r\\nrather ashamed of the unexpected turn which affairs were taking. Dibble\\r\\nsaid a few hurried words to the showman, and then, taking Mrs. Dibble\\r\\nby the arm, disappeared at the side-door.The audience made a rush to follow, but Digby Martin, the magician,\\r\\nplaced himself before the doorway and informed them that he could\\r\\nassure them there was no more fun to be had out of the lady and\\r\\ngentleman who had just retired, and that he would show them something\\r\\nten times funnier than what they had just seen; whereupon Paul quietly\\r\\ntook his leave, and made the best of his way to the Railway Tavern,\\r\\nwhere he found Mrs. Dibble had just arrived with her husband.Mrs. Dibble was in tears, and Dibble was talking to her rather\\r\\nloudly and in an authoritative tone; but half an hour afterwards they\\r\\nwere all[Pg 91] sitting\\r\\nquietly down to refreshment, and Mrs. Dibble’s journey having ended in\\r\\nfinding her husband, Paul now proposed to leave them in order to catch\\r\\nthe mail for Avonworth.Mrs. Dibble thanked him for his kindness, and said she had no\\r\\nfurther need, she thought, to trespass upon him; so he bade them adieu,\\r\\nand went off laughing to the railway station.Amongst the audience who had witnessed the amusing encounter between\\r\\nMr. Dibble and his wife, was Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs, who looked on with a\\r\\ngrave air of quiet enjoyment.You would hardly have known him from our former description. He was\\r\\nattired in respectable professional style, with just an assumption of\\r\\nswellishness. His face was cleanly shaven, and he wore a low-crowned\\r\\nhat, and a black wig. From a light, fair man, he had made himself up\\r\\ndark. To a stranger he wore the marks of foreign travel; his cheeks\\r\\nwere “bronzed with the Eastern sun.”The disguise was complete, and it certainly[Pg 93] made the fellow infinitely better looking\\r\\nthan he was in his customary habit, and far more attractive to the\\r\\n“feminine” mind than in either of his former disguises.He had come down to Severntown partly out of curiosity, partly\\r\\non speculation, with a personal desire to ferret out poor Dibble’s\\r\\n“little game,” and also to run through Avonworth valley, and take\\r\\na peep at the neighbourhood of Barton Hall. His recent advertising\\r\\nscheme had supplied him with a little ready cash, and he had augmented\\r\\nthis at écarté in a recently-established gambling-house, where he was\\r\\nunknown.In funds, and anxious to make up a sufficient sum to enable him to\\r\\nset up as a gentleman on the Continent, he had waited upon Mr. Richard\\r\\nTallant under an assumed name, and that gentleman had denied all\\r\\nknowledge of him to his face. He would have no more dealings with his\\r\\npolice-hunted friend, and they had parted in anger, Richard Tallant\\r\\nthreatening to hand his former companion over to the police as an[Pg 94] impostor, and Mr. Gibbs\\r\\nmaking a vow as he left the high steps of the fine West End house, to\\r\\nbe revenged on “this mushroom upstart.”Defiance and assumption seemed to be the leading features of Richard\\r\\nTallant’s policy. He defied everybody, he assumed an air of injured\\r\\ndignity upon the slightest reference to his past career, talked of\\r\\nenvy, hatred, and malice, almost wept at his father’s name, and gave\\r\\nsplendid illustrations of his wealth in noble public subscriptions.\\r\\nScarcely a list of public donors to any charity that appeared in the\\r\\nTimes without Richard Tallant held a place there. He had even\\r\\nastonished the citizens of Severntown lately by suddenly appearing as a\\r\\nsubscriber to various local institutions. His father had rarely done as\\r\\nmuch as this, though Severntown was the capital of the county in which\\r\\nhe resided; and people soon began to say that young Tallant was not\\r\\nsuch a bad fellow after all.The actions which he had threatened progressed very slowly. Writs\\r\\nhad been issued in[Pg 95]\\r\\nseveral cases; but nothing further seemed to have been done. This,\\r\\nhowever, speedily closed the mouths of other people who might be\\r\\ninclined to say malicious things about the disgraced director of\\r\\nthe Eastern Bank. It is astonishing how people shrink before the\\r\\nthreat of an action for libel and slander, and it oftentimes happens\\r\\nthat those persons who are most ready to talk of vindicating their\\r\\ncharacters, and who threaten actions for that purpose, are often all\\r\\nthat their traducers have said of them. A public man with a tolerably\\r\\nsettled conscience, and assured of his own probity, does not trouble\\r\\nhimself much about the cavillers who attack him, unless they attempt\\r\\nto undermine his credit: then if he cannot afford to have his credit\\r\\nundermined, he will blaze out at his libeller, and endeavour to put\\r\\nhimself right with the world. If he has money enough to stand the\\r\\nundermining principle, he treats it with contempt.It was so with Richard Tallant: he was not an honest man, and not so\\r\\nrich as he professed[Pg 96]\\r\\nto be; and this made it all the more necessary that he should set up\\r\\nfor an injured man and a wealthy one. He convinced many people that\\r\\nhe was the latter, and they speedily gave him credit for being the\\r\\nformer.And thus it was that he had refused to sully even his memory with a\\r\\nknowledge of Shuffleton Gibbs, who at once in his own way held his head\\r\\nabove the plebeian upstart, and thought of his own “gentle blood.”“I will show the trumpery humbug, whether a Gibbs—the last of his\\r\\nrace—shall be scorned for naught by a mushroom iron-dealer. Shuffleton\\r\\nGibbs snubbed and threatened with the police!—Gibbs, the greatest swell\\r\\nof all Oxford undergraduates, the pride of the river and the forum, the\\r\\nman who drove the best cattle, and gave the most sumptuous dinners!\\r\\nIt is certainly going hard with me now, but it shall go harder with\\r\\nRichard Tallant,” and Gibbs smiled sardonically, as he quietly wended\\r\\nhis way homewards, and revolved in his mind the notion of visiting\\r\\nSeverntown.Not only was the ex-swell amongst the audience at the beginning of\\r\\nthat evening’s entertainment, in which Mr. and Mrs. Dibble figured so\\r\\nprominently, but he remained afterwards, and took a lively interest in\\r\\n“the mysterious lady” whom he applauded loudly.She was a lively pleasant looking girl, this showman’s daughter,\\r\\nactive of limb and nimble of tongue. There was something in her\\r\\nappearance far beyond the ordinary show girl. Then she was young and\\r\\nfull of life and buoyancy. She evidently enjoyed the part she played.\\r\\nThe wonder and amazement of the younger portion of her audience,\\r\\nand the undisguised admiration with which some of the elder ones\\r\\ncontemplated her round little figure, her painted cheeks, and her\\r\\nwell-formed arms, gave her a real pleasure. She was slightly coarse\\r\\nin her manners, as the reader has already seen: added to this she\\r\\nwas vain, so the applause of the miscellaneous low-bred audiences\\r\\nbefore whom she performed was agreeable to her; and on the evening\\r\\nin[Pg 98] question she was\\r\\nparticularly delighted at the marked way in which the nearest approach\\r\\nto a gentleman she had even seen in the Temple, expressed his approval\\r\\nof her tricks and of her personal appearance.When Christabel brought out those two packs of cards, and shuffled\\r\\nthem, and handed them round, and tossed them about, Gibbs’s weak eyes\\r\\nbegan to sparkle with unwonted fire.It was quite delightful to see how clever Christabel was with those\\r\\nbits of pasteboard. The audience might cut them as they pleased, and\\r\\nthink of what card they liked, she could always present them with the\\r\\ncounterfeit of their thoughts. Shuffle them as they might, in two or\\r\\nthree cuts she would bring all the suits together: blindfold her,\\r\\nand she could pick out any card that was mentioned. She did twenty\\r\\nclever things with the cards; not the ordinary showman’s tricks—not\\r\\nsimply the innocent jokes which mark the sport in drawing-rooms[Pg 99] at Christmas time; but\\r\\ngenuine clever unaccountable tricks which elicited from Mr. Jefferson\\r\\nCrawley, otherwise Shuffleton Gibbs, frequent exclamations of “bravo,\\r\\nbravo.”It was not the mere tricks that enraptured Mr. Crawley either; but\\r\\nthe dexterous way in which Christabel manipulated the cards and moved\\r\\nany number of them to that part of the pack where it was necessary to\\r\\nher success they should be. Dealing with ordinary players, and with\\r\\nexperienced players too, she could evidently turn up almost any card\\r\\nshe pleased.This was the leading thought that cropped up in the mind of Mr.\\r\\nCrawley. He envied the girl her dexterity, her lithe quick fingers, and\\r\\nthen he thought what a fortune she might be to any one who could give\\r\\nher an education worthy of her powers.When the performance was at an end, he waited until the magician\\r\\nemerged from behind the curtain, whereupon he complimented him[Pg 100] upon his powers, and\\r\\ndesired to be introduced to his wonderful daughter.The showman with the aliases, looked inquiringly into the face of\\r\\nthe gentleman with the same possessions. Gibbs thought he understood\\r\\nthe expression.“I have an interest in a certain exhibition of some importance,\\r\\nsir,” said Gibbs, drawing himself up to his full height and forcing\\r\\nas much assumption of virtuous circumspection into his bleary eyes as\\r\\npossible, “and I have also a very slight acquaintance with a gentleman\\r\\nto whom you directed one Dibble to write requesting a loan.”“Your humble servant,” said the showman. “Christabel, when you have\\r\\ndressed—this is our last performance to-night, sir,—when you have\\r\\ndressed, here’s a gent wishes to see you.”Momus hereupon came out to see the “gent,” making her best bow to\\r\\nGibbs, who took no notice of the “dawg,” but went on talking to the\\r\\nmagician.“Is it only fifty pounds you require for the proposed extension of\\r\\nthis exhibition, haw?” said Gibbs.“No more and no less,” said the showman, giving Momus a friendly\\r\\nkick in the ribs for persisting in forcing her attentions upon a “gent”\\r\\nwho seemed studiously to disregard them.“Well, I think the matter may be arranged. My friend is a\\r\\nclose-fisted fellow. I have—haw—only a very slight acquaintance with\\r\\nhim; but being in the neighbourhood, I undertook to call on his\\r\\naccount; and, between ourselves, I have stayed here—haw—a little on\\r\\nmy own. Is there any likelihood of your clever daughter accepting an\\r\\nengagement in a large concern—a permanent affair in town? You see—haw—I\\r\\nam straightforward with you.”“Well, it aint a question that, as can be answered in a moment.\\r\\nWhat would be the figure—and could you do anything for me?” said the\\r\\nshowman.At this juncture a boy entered at the side-door[Pg 102] with a note in his hand,\\r\\nwhich note he presented to Mr. Martin.“Here, Chris—come, come, what a time you are!” said the showman,\\r\\ndisappearing behind the curtain, that the wonderful lady might spell\\r\\nout the contents of the letter. She had been taught to read and write\\r\\nin her early days, and she had not much difficulty in making out that\\r\\nher father’s presence was requested immediately, by Mr. Thomas Dibble,\\r\\nat the Railway Tavern.“Well, then, I must go,” said the showman. “You’ll be careful with\\r\\nthis ’ere swell outside, mind, and make no promises—d’ye hear?”“Yes, father,” said the girl, who was not just at that time on the\\r\\nbest of terms with her parent, and colleague in the mystic art, seeing\\r\\nthat he had knocked her down on the previous night, and kicked the\\r\\nsupper-things over, because she had contradicted him and expressed a\\r\\ndetermination not to join in the scheme for introducing the Skeleton\\r\\ninto their exhibition.When she came forth Mr. Martin introduced[Pg 103] her to the “gent,” and with a\\r\\nprecautionary motion of his finger, he left the pair, in answer to\\r\\nDibble.“I am delighted of this—haw—opportunity,” said Gibbs, showing his\\r\\nteeth as of old, and trying to look fascinating, “of congratulating you\\r\\non your ability.”She looked quite bright and sparkling; she had made a much more\\r\\ncareful evening toilette than usual.“Making fun!” said Gibbs, taking her hand. “I should be more inclined\\r\\nto make love,” he said; “for you certainly are the prettiest girl I\\r\\nhave seen this many a day.”“I declare positively you have quite made a fool of me—haw—to-night,”\\r\\nhe went on, showing his teeth again. “You are not offended at my saying\\r\\nso?”There was a charcoal stove in the show, and Gibbs drew the young\\r\\nlady of the mystic cups to a seat beside it, and thereupon told her\\r\\nthat he had fallen madly in love with her; that he was a gentleman,\\r\\nthough a poor one; that if she felt she could love him in return, he\\r\\nwould marry her. But she must keep what he had said to her a secret\\r\\nfrom her father.Then he dexterously drew from her an account of her life; the story\\r\\nof Dibble’s joining the exhibition; and, above all, an account of the\\r\\nquarrel with her father; and finally, after a lengthened conversation,\\r\\nhe escorted her to the little lodging close by, Momus being left to\\r\\nmind the show, after Christabel had duly locked up the side-door,\\r\\nextinguished the light, and let down the platform.Gibbs was scrupulously attentive and gallant to the girl, and when\\r\\nhe left her she promised to give him an answer next day upon the[Pg 105] momentous question of\\r\\nelopement and marriage.It was a rapid courtship this, but cleverly done; and Gibbs, you\\r\\nsee, had had a large experience in this way. Christabel was so much\\r\\nimpressed that she went up the dirty creaking stairs, and paraded\\r\\nbefore about twelve inches of looking-glass, by the light of a tallow\\r\\ncandle.Her father, when he returned home that night, was unusually\\r\\nbumptious in his manner towards Christabel, his daughter, and more than\\r\\nusually tipsy. Dibble had obtained a partial promise from Mrs. Dibble\\r\\nthat the showman should not want for fifty pounds, and before that,\\r\\nas we have seen, a “gent” had given him similar hopes. Everything was\\r\\ngoing well with him, and he was independent of everybody; his daughter,\\r\\ntoo, felt particularly independent that night, and the result was a\\r\\nwordy warfare about the Skeleton.Christabel hated the sight of the Skeleton, and what was more, she\\r\\nwould leave the exhibition if he entered it.The showman swore that the Skeleton should come into the exhibition,\\r\\nand what was more, by ——, she should marry the Skeleton if she did not\\r\\nmind what she was saying.This was the greatest bit of tyranny in words which the showman\\r\\nfelt he could threaten, and he seemed to gloat over the idea. Yes, she\\r\\nshould marry the death’s head and bones, he said, and he chuckled and\\r\\nlaughed and thumped the table, and became quite jocular at the bare\\r\\nnotion of such a union.Christabel, however, flamed up in return, and by degrees the showman\\r\\nbecame terribly angry, and threatened to turn her out of doors.The end was that Christabel went up-stairs, locked herself in her\\r\\nbedroom, and began to look out her things for packing off the next\\r\\nday. Meanwhile the showman lay down by the fire, went to sleep, and\\r\\ndreamt he was proprietor of a pair of giants, two skeletons, five\\r\\nboa constrictors, and a wax-work museum: that he wore a tiger-skin\\r\\ncoat, and walked about smoking a cigar,[Pg 107] whilst a brass band beneath a gorgeous\\r\\ndisplay of pictures performed the Conquering Hero, with real gas\\r\\nshining on their music books, and that all he had to do was to wear the\\r\\ntiger-skin coat, smoke thick cigars, and swear at everybody who did not\\r\\nplease him.A white, wet, grovelling mist; with a long, black procession\\r\\ncreeping through it; and the solemn tolling of a village bell; nodding\\r\\nplumes and draped horses; a small group of well-dressed farmers, the\\r\\ntenants of the late Mr. Tallant.There was something weird and miserable about the whole thing, as\\r\\nArthur Phillips viewed it at a distance; something that chilled him and\\r\\nbowed him down.He followed the mourners into the church; the solemn village church,\\r\\nwith its high-backed pews, brass monuments, and marble effigies; the\\r\\nsolemn little church, with the ivy nodding round the porch, and the\\r\\ndamp making big blotches on the pavement.“In the midst of life we are in death.” The words were repeated back\\r\\nagain from the walls, and the kneeling effigies in stone seemed to take\\r\\nup the text and say it over again with the echoes.The great black coffin stood in the chancel, and Arthur could not\\r\\nhelp picturing the dead face of the merchant.How changed everything was. How sad, how hopeless! And yet Arthur’s\\r\\nown deep love, for a moment, lit up his thoughts with a hope that had\\r\\nscarcely had a place in his heart before; but he banished the thought\\r\\nin a moment as selfish.Richard Tallant was there amongst the mourners, loudest in his\\r\\nAmens, and apparently most moved, as he should be, at the pathetic\\r\\nsolemnity of the church service.Arthur quietly walked over the fields to the Somertons, whilst the\\r\\ncoffin was being laid in the grave.A faint streak or two of sunlight struggled[Pg 110] through the mist here and there, but\\r\\nwith little or no influence on the soddened, damp atmosphere, which\\r\\npenetrated everything.Arthur found Mrs. Somerton alone in a high-backed chair by the fire.\\r\\nHe knew that he was no favourite with the bailiff’s wife; but he bade\\r\\nher “Good-morning” with a quiet courtesy peculiarly his own, and she\\r\\nwas evidently not displeased at the visit.“You have been ill, I fear,” said Arthur, noticing the unusual\\r\\nwrappers about the arm-chair, and Mrs. Somerton’s rather pale face.“I don’t know that there is much to congratulate about,” she said,\\r\\nlooking at him with a sad expression in her big eyes; “but I have got\\r\\nover the worst of it, they say, thank you.”“I was very much shocked to hear of Mr.[Pg 111] Tallant’s death. I only heard of it\\r\\nyesterday,” said Arthur.“What has become of you lately?—you have not been in this\\r\\nneighbourhood for a long time,” said Mrs. Somerton, evidently only\\r\\nattending to her own thoughts.“I have been engaged on an important work, which has occupied me\\r\\nalmost night and day for several months past,” Arthur said.“Will you not sit down, sir?” Mrs. Somerton asked. “I am sorry I\\r\\ncan’t get about to offer you a seat.”Arthur sat down beside the neat bright fireplace, and looked into\\r\\nthe burning coals with a variety of curious feelings: he longed to ask\\r\\nall kinds of questions, but feared to do so.“Many strange things may occur in a few months,” said Mrs. Somerton;\\r\\n“the purpose of a life-time is easily upset.”“We all think we are very clever, and we[Pg 112] go on planning and planning; but things\\r\\nare not to be as we like: there is a Power above us.”“Ah! if we only knew that, at the beginning, Mr. Phillips,” said\\r\\nMrs. Somerton earnestly, “if we could be content to learn that from\\r\\nother people’s experience: ‘better learn from your neighbour’s scathe\\r\\nthan from your own;’ but we learn from our own, Mr. Phillips, we learn\\r\\nfrom our own.”Arthur had upon a former occasion been struck with the snatches of\\r\\nmoral and proverbial philosophy which characterised Mrs. Somerton’s\\r\\nconversations; but he had thought her a clever cynical countrywoman\\r\\nbefore, and had disliked her: now he rapidly felt himself beginning to\\r\\ntake a deep interest in her.“Folks that do wrong have generally plenty of excuses; but I\\r\\nhave none worth the name of excuse, though they say a bad excuse is\\r\\nbetter[Pg 113] than none.\\r\\nYou are surprised at my talk: you will not be so before the night is\\r\\nover.”“Surely nothing has happened that does not appear to me. Poor Mr.\\r\\nTallant is dead, and you have been ill; is there anything else?” Arthur\\r\\nasked as calmly as he could.“I won’t torture you,—I know your secret, sir. Miss Phœbe\\r\\nis well, though, poor soul, she is sadly cut up; but misery is no\\r\\nrespecter of persons. Ambition and pride are the ruin of most people.\\r\\nYou would hardly think I had been an ambitious, scheming woman, with\\r\\nplans far above the station I hold?” she went on excitedly.“Ah, well, it is a long story, and I will not weary you with it;\\r\\neverybody thinks their own stories interesting to everybody else; but,\\r\\nthere, mine need not be told. I have been an ambitious, scheming woman\\r\\never since I was a woman, and I have always been foiled. Half my life\\r\\nhas been[Pg 114] spent in\\r\\nstudying how I should play the ace without knowing whether I held it\\r\\nor not, and in the other half I have been learning the truth of the\\r\\nproverb that wine poured out is not wine swallowed. Lincolnshire women\\r\\nhave a way of talking in proverbs, Mr. Phillips: one can say a good\\r\\ndeal like that without seeming to.”Arthur was altogether at a loss to understand Mrs. Somerton; but he\\r\\nboded ill from all this apparent mystery, and yet a voice seemed to\\r\\nwhisper hope all through it.“You are in love with Miss Phœbe,” said Mrs. Somerton at\\r\\nlength, and with singular abruptness; “I know it. I have not watched\\r\\nand watched with a mother’s eye for nothing, and I think the young\\r\\nlady loves you in return—if there is such a thing as love—and I begin\\r\\nto think there may be, or something better than love, something better\\r\\nthan love.”The woman repeated these latter words with unaffected tenderness\\r\\nas she remembered how kindly, how generously, how tenderly, her[Pg 115] husband, Luke Somerton,\\r\\nhad nursed her in her illness; how when he knew all, he had not\\r\\nupbraided her; how he had pitied her and bade her be of good heart, for\\r\\nthat a wrong atoned for was a wrong undone; how in the early watches\\r\\nof the night she had seen him by her bedside wakeful and gentle, but\\r\\nyet manly, as she remembered him when he was young in the grand old\\r\\nLincolnshire wolds.“Something better than love,” she continued—“friendship,\\r\\nbenevolence, charity, sympathy—I know not what you call it; but perhaps\\r\\nit may be love, after all,” she went on; “and I don’t think there is\\r\\nany wrong ambition about you, Mr. Phillips, if you will forgive me for\\r\\nsaying so. A man who can sit in the sun painting pictures and all that\\r\\nsort of thing, and be content with it, can’t very well be much wrong,\\r\\nexcept that he is only a painter after all. Don’t be angry, sir; we\\r\\nnever thought much of painters in Lincolnshire; we used to look at them\\r\\nthe same as we did poets and such like; but I have heard that some\\r\\nof[Pg 116] them make money,\\r\\nand can keep up a good house. However, I will say no more about that;\\r\\nbut somehow, sir, I think you will find things going favourably, so far\\r\\nas Phœbe is concerned. We shall see; if such should be the case,\\r\\nMr. Phillips, no matter what you hear of me, you will not forget that\\r\\nI was the first to give you hope—that will be something to think of,\\r\\nperhaps some little consolation to me.”Arthur was too much agitated to ask any questions. He thanked Mrs.\\r\\nSomerton as well as he could for what she had said, and he began to\\r\\nlook out into the future with hope.We never know how unexpectedly Hope may pay us a gorgeous visit;\\r\\nhow often she comes when we least expect her. With death barring his\\r\\nway, and funeral plumes crossing his path, Arthur Phillips could hardly\\r\\nhave expected Hope to come by his side and whisper so confidently of\\r\\nhappiness almost beyond his most sanguine thoughts. Once or twice\\r\\nin the darkness, once or twice between the acts of the day’s solemn\\r\\ndrama,[Pg 117] a faint\\r\\nwhisper had lighted up his soul as we have seen; but here he stood at\\r\\nlast almost in the full blaze of hope, and the light had come from the\\r\\ndarkest of all places, in his own estimation.And so Arthur sat and pondered, and Mrs. Somerton quietly regarding\\r\\nhim, dosed off into a quiet slumber, induced by the fatigue of thought\\r\\nand conversation which Arthur’s visit had occasioned.Far away amongst the Lincolnshire meadows, where the long, lazy\\r\\nriver flowed by the corn-fields and lingered amongst the reeds and\\r\\nrushes; far away in the green and golden fields, and over the brown\\r\\nand loamy furrows; hemmed in by short hedges, and dotted here and\\r\\nthere with ricks of hay and straw and stray clumps of trees; far away\\r\\namongst Lincolnshire homesteads, and mills with their swinging sails,\\r\\nand square-towered churches, and broad lanes, and long teams of horses\\r\\ndragging well-stocked waggons; far away in the past the mind of the\\r\\nbailiff’s wife was[Pg 118]\\r\\nwandering, and the dream was a happy one, for it dealt with childhood\\r\\nonly.Arthur stole out whilst she slept. The mists had crept about the\\r\\nvalley and were hovering over the hill-tops.He started off to visit some of the familiar scenes where he had\\r\\nsat in the long summer days, wondering and hoping and painting in hazy\\r\\nromantic dreams which were not all happiness.His thoughts were strangely mixed and intricate now: a host of\\r\\nanxious feelings had been awakened which he could not control, and\\r\\nwhich he could hardly understand.“No, I am here,” said her husband, removing a crape hatband from his\\r\\nhat and laying it upon the table.“Not much; I think I have done all the talking, Luke. And so you\\r\\nhave buried the poor gentleman?” she went on, mournfully.“They were all going into the dining-room as I came past. The lawyer\\r\\nasked me to come in; but I thought you’d be lonely, Sarah, and so I\\r\\ncame home.”Mrs. Somerton could not help thinking that Luke had better have\\r\\nstayed and heard the will read; but she was too considerate now, to say\\r\\nso.When he was gone, Arthur Phillips came back again to the bailiff’s\\r\\nhouse, determined to learn why he had so suddenly filled himself with\\r\\nhopes that excited him beyond description. He would not be content with\\r\\nvague hints and proverbial sayings, and he would not conceal his own\\r\\nfeelings with regard to Miss Tallant. Mrs. Somerton could evidently\\r\\nhelp him in some way or another; she knew more than she chose to tell;\\r\\nshe knew what he ought to know, and he would endeavour to learn what\\r\\nshe did know.Mrs. Somerton did not need much persuasion to reveal her secret.\\r\\nShe knew that in a few hours Arthur would know it, and it was a\\r\\nsatisfactory sort of penance to tell him herself, and to confess\\r\\nall her plotting and meannesses; to disclose to him her feelings\\r\\nwith regard to herself; to show how jealous she was of her daughter;\\r\\nand to point some of her moral aphorisms with[Pg 121] illustrations from this last phase of the\\r\\nfailure of her schemes.It was indeed a new light this to Arthur. He had dreamed of all\\r\\nsorts of contingencies which might bring Phœbe nearer to him,\\r\\nand his only hope was in the production of some great work that should\\r\\nopen up a golden vista which the merchant might comprehend; for Arthur\\r\\nhad always regarded Mr. Tallant as the wealthy commoner who gauged men\\r\\nand things by money, and this had disheartened him even more than the\\r\\nthoughts of his own shortcomings and the beauty of her whom he had\\r\\nbeen rash enough to go on loving without daring even to hint at his\\r\\npassion.And now fate had decreed that this difficulty should disappear. Did\\r\\nhe blame Phœbe’s mother? No. He sat before her stupified with\\r\\namazement.His first thought, now that the great barrier of all was cleared\\r\\naway, was of his own unworthiness; but he had courage enough to\\r\\ntell Mrs. Somerton that she had excited hopes which had[Pg 122] never before dared to\\r\\nmount so high. He had heard her story with the greatest surprise, and,\\r\\nbut that his own heart hoped and desired its truth, it was almost too\\r\\nextraordinary for belief.Supposing he dared to hope that Phœbe loved him, had he her\\r\\nmother’s consent to ask her the question?Mrs. Somerton replied in the affirmative. There were many ways in\\r\\nwhich amends might be made towards wiping out great wrongs, and it\\r\\nseemed as if God had spared her life that she might have time to repair\\r\\nnearly all the injury she had done.The last will and testament of Mr. Christopher\\r\\nTallant set forth in proper legal phraseology, at great length, that\\r\\nthe person known as Phœbe Tallant, and who was understood to\\r\\nbe his daughter, was the daughter of Sarah Somerton, wife of Luke\\r\\nSomerton, farm bailiff; and that the person known as Amy Somerton, and\\r\\nwho had passed hitherto as the daughter of the said Luke Somerton, was\\r\\nhis, the testator’s, daughter.This had been satisfactorily proved to him by the said Sarah\\r\\nSomerton, who had changed the said persons when they were infants; and\\r\\nthe likeness of the late beloved testator’s wife bore testimony to the\\r\\ntruth thereof.But though the testator was fully satisfied of this, and though he\\r\\nacknowledged the person known as the said Amy Somerton to be his lawful\\r\\nchild, his will had been drawn in such a way that its validity and\\r\\nlegal weight should not simply rest upon this; but certain checks and\\r\\nexplanations and provisions were made, the result being that the person\\r\\nhitherto known as Amy Somerton should be his heiress, and henceforth\\r\\ntake the name of Tallant.To this lady he left the whole of his real and personal estates,\\r\\nfurniture, plate, linen, and moneys of all descriptions, banked or\\r\\nfunded.This was set forth in a deed of great length, dealing as it did with\\r\\nan estate which could so well afford long clauses on many sheets of\\r\\nparchment.Property of the value of five hundred a year was left to Phœbe\\r\\nSomerton; a legacy of 2000l. to her father, and numerous small\\r\\nlegacies to servants and others.The name of Richard Tallant was not mentioned[Pg 125] in any way, and that gentleman resolved\\r\\nto dispute the validity of the will.He told the lawyer that he would file a bill in Chancery the very\\r\\nnext day. The lawyer smiled and said he had no objection.The lawyer had discreetly prepared the two girls for what was to\\r\\ncome, so that the extraordinary revelation and the great change might\\r\\nnot come upon them so suddenly as to be dangerous.The whole truth, when it was disclosed to them, changed all those\\r\\nfeelings of estrangement which had lately been engendered by Amy’s\\r\\ndesperate conduct.In a moment Phœbe, with all the nobleness of her nature, felt\\r\\nAmy’s wrongs; and Amy’s heart overflowed with gratitude to Phœbe,\\r\\nand with love and sympathy.And then they sat together hand in hand, each occupied with her own\\r\\nthoughts; each too much under the influence of the change which had\\r\\ncome to pass, to have any very clear thoughts about it.Phœbe had all along mourned for Mr. Tallant with all the\\r\\nsorrow of a daughter; she had often felt, as my readers know, that all\\r\\nher love was not reciprocated, but she knew how much her mother had\\r\\nbeen loved, and how deeply her loss had affected him, and she loved him\\r\\nas a daughter and would continue to do so.She could not for the moment bring herself to look upon Mrs.\\r\\nSomerton as her mother: she had always admired Luke, and had spent\\r\\nmany an hour talking to him amongst the poultry and the sheep, and\\r\\nin the corn-fields. It was no degradation to be the daughter of such\\r\\na man as Luke Somerton, and none, perhaps, for that matter, to[Pg 127] be the daughter of his\\r\\nwife; but it was a great change—too great for Phœbe to comprehend\\r\\nit thus far. Her first thought had been for Amy, and Amy’s first\\r\\nthought had been for Phœbe.But in a few short hours Phœbe’s highly-wrought sensibilities\\r\\nbegan to reflect back upon her the true meaning of the change in her\\r\\nposition. She was only a visitor here. She had enjoyed many privileges\\r\\nin this house, and many advantages; she was thankful for them, but they\\r\\nhad not been hers by right, and now they were hers no longer in any\\r\\nsense.She would go home. Something like a shudder came over her as she\\r\\nsaid this to herself in her own room, and she rebuked herself for\\r\\nit, and knelt down and prayed, thanking God for all his mercies, and\\r\\nearnestly soliciting His guidance and protection.What a sweet, fair face it was, turned upwards in supplication;\\r\\nthe deep blue beseeching eyes, the half-opened lips, the pale cheeks,\\r\\nthe round, arched neck, the long wavy hair thrown back:[Pg 128] what more beautiful\\r\\npicture than such a woman kneeling in prayer?How different was Amy’s occupation. Pacing to and fro in her room,\\r\\nand looking at herself now and then in the long mirrors which adorned\\r\\nthe wardrobes, she was torn by contending feelings, too varied for\\r\\npeace, too strong for aught else, at that moment, but walking.She was overcome by her advancement. Lately we have seen how high\\r\\nher ambition had soared; we have seen how she had changed, how she had\\r\\nmarked out a new line of action, how she had set her heart on something\\r\\nalmost beyond the romantic dreams of mere ambition.Her love for Lionel Hammerton—her deep, mad love had been trampled\\r\\non, and she had risen a new being, with all the pride of her dead\\r\\nmother beating in every vein, with a sense of insult and wrong far\\r\\nbeyond what she had a right to feel, far beyond the measure of\\r\\nHammerton’s offence.The appearance of Earl Verner at Barton Hall that day had given\\r\\na new tone to her life. He[Pg\\r\\n129] had appeared at the very moment when decision seemed\\r\\nwavering; he had come upon her like an interpretation of her own\\r\\nthoughts, as if Fate said, “Here is your opportunity;” and then it\\r\\nwas that she determined to play for high stakes, even at the risk of\\r\\nridicule and failure.And now that she stood on the hill top, and had only, she knew, to\\r\\nraise her finger and beckon, she was bewildered. Lord Verner had\\r\\ncalled at Barton Hall twice since that memorable meeting, and had on\\r\\nthe second occasion evinced marked admiration of Amy, such as could\\r\\nnot be mistaken, notwithstanding that he knew her position, for he had\\r\\nsignified as much.If even her lowly birth and her poverty had not scared Earl Verner\\r\\naway, she knew well enough that her wealth would only enhance her\\r\\nbeauty and attractions.What delicious revenge to marry Lionel’s brother, and to make the\\r\\nchance of a coronet for him all the more remote!And yet, how she had loved this man! How[Pg 130] fervently, how fondly? Did he know\\r\\nhow much? She asked herself the question, and then blushed at the\\r\\nremembrance of a hundred little acts in which she had disclosed it to\\r\\nhim.Had he encouraged her love? She asked herself that question, too;\\r\\nand then she recalled softly whispered compliments, and delicately\\r\\nhinted regrets that society should not welcome beauty into its ranks\\r\\nwithout requiring that it should be backed with ancestry. And above\\r\\nall, she remembered a time when he told her a simple narrative, how\\r\\nthe brother of a noble earl had loved a beautiful maiden, a farmer’s\\r\\ndaughter, and how when he had made a name beyond that which mere rank\\r\\ncould give, he came back and married her; and how, upon that occasion,\\r\\nhe had kissed her and pressed her hand, and left her bathed in tears of\\r\\njoy and fear.And yet, without a word he had left her; without even telling her\\r\\nthat he loved her; not even giving her the consolation of hope. She\\r\\nhad been too confiding, weak, silly, and he had treated her[Pg 131] accordingly: he should\\r\\nsee how Amy Tallant would requite him.She was walking to and fro, with her earnest eyes looking out into\\r\\nthe new, strange future, when a servant brought her the card of Mr.\\r\\nArthur Phillips.Arthur began to apologise for calling at such a time, but Amy\\r\\nsilenced him at once by telling him she had desired to see him; and,\\r\\nfull of her own purposes and feelings, she said:—“Pray excuse me if I appear inquisitive or rude. I have ample\\r\\nreasons for going a little beyond what may seem courteous under the\\r\\ncircumstances. Does he mention me in his letter?”“Pray pardon me, Mr. Phillips; I assure you these questions are of\\r\\ngreat moment—they concern the happiness of more than one person.”“Really, Miss Somerton—Miss Tallant—I beg your pardon,” said Arthur;\\r\\n“but you must not[Pg 133]\\r\\nexpect me to go into our private conversations.”“I do, sir; I command—I entreat,” she added, in supplicating\\r\\naccents, “did he charge you with any message to me?”“Suppose you were my brother, sir, and suppose I loved that man,\\r\\nyour friend; did he speak of me in such a way as you would wish for the\\r\\nman to speak whom your sister loved? You see I am plain with you—be you\\r\\nhonest with me; Yes or no.”“And you profess to be in love; nay, you need not start.\\r\\nDo you think I do not know your secret? Do you think I do not know\\r\\nhow many sleepless nights you have spent; how you have been tossed\\r\\nbetween hope and fear; how you[Pg\\r\\n134] have cursed your lot, and consoled yourself with poetic\\r\\ndreams, and the voice of her you love? I tell you my happiness and all\\r\\nmy hopes are at stake. I know well enough—my own instincts tell me that\\r\\nhe did but trifle with my love, and your silence only confirms it. Now\\r\\nthat wealth falls in to fill up the scale and weigh down the balance,\\r\\nI should despise myself if I accepted compromise; for I very nearly\\r\\nhate him as it is; but I seek for full satisfaction. I will ask you\\r\\nbut one more question. Did he speak of me before he left England as\\r\\nyou would speak to a friend who had your confidence concerning\\r\\nPhœbe?”“Thank you,” said Amy, “thank you, Mr. Phillips, sincerely;\\r\\nand now may I beg that you never repeat what has passed in this\\r\\nconversation?”Amy put out her hand, and said good-bye, and left the artist\\r\\nwondering at her extraordinary conduct.Arthur stood irresolutely wondering what he should do next. He had\\r\\nintended to ask Amy quietly to inform her friend of his presence here;\\r\\nbut she had given him little or no opportunity to do that, as you have\\r\\nseen.He looked round the library where the merchant had been accustomed\\r\\nto sit at his desk. There was no change in the room. The light elegant\\r\\nbook-shelves were there. The grandly bound books were there as usual.\\r\\nPens and ink and blotting pads all in their places; and the leather\\r\\nchair stood near the desk by the window; but the merchant lay quietly\\r\\nin his grave.Presently Arthur rang the bell, and summoned up courage enough to\\r\\nsend his card up to[Pg 136]\\r\\nPhœbe Somerton, who presented herself almost immediately.She was a good deal changed; but her black clothes seemed only to\\r\\nadd a sort of refining touch to her beauty.“I am so pleased to see you, Mr. Phillips,” she said frankly,\\r\\nputting out her hand, “if one really ought to be pleased at\\r\\nanything, considering that we have buried my father—I mean Mr.\\r\\nTallant—to-day.”“I am sure you will pardon me,” said Arthur, “if with the view\\r\\nof suppressing any embarrassment I tell you that I have been made\\r\\nacquainted with all that has taken place. I came down here from London\\r\\nyesterday, ignorant even of Mr. Tallant’s death; but I could not\\r\\nreturn without venturing to say to you, personally, how deeply, how\\r\\nrespectfully, I sympathise with you in your troubles.”There was a tone of deferential homage and sincere interest\\r\\nin Arthur’s manner which did not fail to make an impression upon\\r\\nPhœbe.“I am sure I thank you sincerely, Mr. Phillips, and appreciate, as I\\r\\nhope I ought, your great kindness: I have frequently wondered why you\\r\\nhad deserted Barton,” said Phœbe.“O no; on the contrary,” said Arthur, looking at the speaker with\\r\\nundisguised emotion, “engagements of a pressing character have kept me\\r\\nconfined to my studio.”Then the conversation dropped into matters of fact concerning the\\r\\nlate Mr. Tallant’s troubles, his illness and death; and eventually\\r\\nPhœbe Somerton and Arthur shook hands, and Arthur asked\\r\\npermission to call and see his fair pupil on an early day, which\\r\\npermission was readily granted.And so Arthur went back to Severntown, to his quiet house beneath the\\r\\nshadow of the old cathedral, full of new hopes, a new man, and with the\\r\\nfuture opening up to him bright and sunny.He found several congratulatory letters at home about his work,\\r\\n“Seeking New Homes,” and two offers of purchase, the highest being\\r\\nfifteen hundred pounds.This was cheerful; for though Arthur was by no means mercenary, he\\r\\nfelt that this was a practical tribute to the excellence of his work;\\r\\nand, moreover, he had, as we have already learnt, been a heavy loser\\r\\nthrough the recent bank failures.He sat in the firelight with his happy dreams, listening to the roar\\r\\nof the river without, and letting it bear away his thoughts on its\\r\\nbosom. The cathedral chimes fell dreamily upon his ear, and he thought\\r\\nof a merry village peal which might some day be rung in token of the\\r\\nconsummation of his wildest hopes.Thoughts of the cold damp church, with the coffin in it, would crop\\r\\nup now and then, but they had no abiding-place in his mind that night;\\r\\nhappier thoughts crowded in and dispersed them.His long lonely life, with quiet grassy spots in it here and there,\\r\\nand nooks of peace, dedicated to art, was before him. He travelled\\r\\nover it again in the firelight. He saw himself a studious boy without\\r\\nplaymates, without companions; he saw himself verging into manhood\\r\\nwith a strangely awakened love of art and nature, and with only a poor\\r\\nbroken-down painter taking any interest in the mysterious signs which\\r\\nhis genius would make in spite of himself. He saw his humble home and\\r\\nhis toiling parent; a mother without one gleam of sympathy in common\\r\\nwith his aspirations, and who only bore querulously with his odd ways,\\r\\nand a father whose besetting sin was the bottle, which was his ruin.He thought of his early struggles, of his early privations, of the\\r\\nburning passionate love of his[Pg\\r\\n140] art. It was a rugged, broken road at the starting, and\\r\\nhis first success had brought with it a bitter pang; it would have\\r\\ngladdened his heart to have given his father and mother this evidence\\r\\nof the practical correctness of his judgment, to have shown them how\\r\\nhonourable art is, and how it elevates the humble worker into the\\r\\nhighest rank, and places him on a level with princes.A lonely, lowly road, but by-and-by covered with mosses and soft\\r\\ngrass, and sober flowers and shady ferns; and then umbrageous trees\\r\\nthrew their arms over it, and gleams of sunshine came through the\\r\\nbranches. Presently another figure appeared in this more cheerful path,\\r\\nbut it only seemed to mock the student with its beauty, and to lure him\\r\\non into hopes that would only strew his way again with broken rocks,\\r\\nand thorns, and rough places.All at once, however, the sun shone out full upon him, and the\\r\\nfigure held out its hand, and smiled with truthful human eyes.\\r\\nAnd[Pg 141] something said\\r\\nwithin him that he would have a companion at last to share his journey,\\r\\nand that the happy, happy goal was near.That same night Phœbe sat before the parlour-fire at the Hall\\r\\nFarm, with Mrs. Somerton on one side and Luke on the other.They had evidently had a long and affecting interview. The storm was\\r\\npast; the rush of the tempest was over; and it had left Mrs. Somerton\\r\\ngazing through tears at her daughter.No words of rebuke, no complaint, had been uttered by Phœbe;\\r\\nshe had said nothing but what was kind and dutiful, nothing that could\\r\\nwound, except that her kindness stung her mother more than hard words\\r\\nwould have done.The remorseful woman had burst out into sobs and heart-breaking\\r\\nlamentations at the first tender acts of filial forgiveness, and Luke\\r\\nhad hardly known how to master his own feelings when, in reply to\\r\\nsome remark of his conveying[Pg\\r\\n142] the thought that she would be ashamed of such a father, she\\r\\nhad flung herself into his arms and called him Father.There was something hysterical at first in the whole proceeding;\\r\\nbut by-and-by the calm came, and then they all three sat and talked.\\r\\nPhœbe was hardly herself, though she had made up her mind so\\r\\nfully how she ought to act and how she would act.A sense of duty had impelled her to come home to her father and\\r\\nmother, and there was a vague, strange sense of happiness and safety\\r\\nin sitting between them. The Hall without her sometime father seemed\\r\\nfull of desolation and shadows. Unaccustomed sounds had struck upon her\\r\\near, she thought she heard the merchant’s voice and his footstep on the\\r\\nstairs.A sense of fear and loneliness had been upon her; and she had come\\r\\nhome to her father and her mother, and now there was a sweet lulling\\r\\nfeeling of peace at her heart which she had not felt for a long time\\r\\npast.Had the visit of Arthur Phillips done anything to enhance that\\r\\nsensation of quiet and repose? He had been in her thoughts more than\\r\\nonce, as she sat there with her hand in her father’s.It was no use Luke or his wife expostulating with Phœbe;\\r\\nhome she had come, and at home she would stay. And when at length the\\r\\nwondering domestic at the Hall Farm came to show her to the room which\\r\\nhad been always set apart for Amy’s use, Phœbe knelt and received\\r\\nher mother’s blessing, bade Luke good-night, and called him “Father”\\r\\nagain.Luke and his wife had rarely sat up so late as upon this eventful\\r\\nnight, and so much good will sometimes come out of evil, and sins\\r\\nconfessed are so nearly atoned for—that Luke and his wife loved each\\r\\nother now for the first time. There was a deep wondering pity in Luke’s\\r\\nheart for his wife now that he saw the secret of her life, and looked\\r\\nat the drooping head and the eyes filled with tears. Mrs. Somerton\\r\\nhad not expected such a generous forgiveness, and so much[Pg 144] sympathy and gentleness,\\r\\nat Luke’s hands. In the last few weeks she had suffered a world of\\r\\nremorse for her past shrewish conduct, and now her gratitude knew no\\r\\nbounds; gratitude and sympathy and pity, and memories of the past,\\r\\nmingled together in these two hearts, and on the steady downward path\\r\\nof life they came to love each other with a quiet calm love that is\\r\\nnearest akin to a long-proved generous friendship.The winter slipped swiftly away, without making many important\\r\\nchanges in the positions of the people in our story.Important events were in course of consummation, but no special\\r\\nincident cropped up to mark the gradual development of the various\\r\\ncircumstances calling for anything more than simple narration.Earl Verner had taken several opportunities to renew his\\r\\nacquaintance with Amy, and we must do his lordship the justice to say\\r\\nthat her sudden and unexpected advancement in fortune had little or\\r\\nno influence upon his course of wooing, for he was hit at that first\\r\\ninterview, hit irredeemably.[Pg\\r\\n146] There was something in Amy besides her good looks which had\\r\\nfairly fascinated the earl. The idea of a thoroughly companionable and\\r\\nintellectual woman had never presented itself to him before. Hitherto\\r\\nwomen had represented to him trouble, bother, putting yourself out of\\r\\nthe way, and everything that was not being easy and lazy and lolling\\r\\nabout, and grubbing amongst old books, and fadding with ancient china,\\r\\nand being constantly delighted with pictures. Woman engrossed all this\\r\\nin herself. She wanted to be old china and books and pictures and\\r\\nantiquities and everything all in one; and this notion did not suit\\r\\nEarl Verner; but in Amy he felt that there would not be this autocracy.\\r\\nShe was evidently as much interested in these things as he was himself,\\r\\nand, considering how much his condescension in marrying her would\\r\\nelevate her in the social scale, he would have an influence over her\\r\\nthat he could not hope to have over a woman in his own walk of life.The more he saw of Amy Tallant the more[Pg 147] enraptured he became, and well he might,\\r\\nfor Amy spared no pains to make herself charming and agreeable in his\\r\\neyes; indeed, Amy had vowed to herself that she would marry him. She\\r\\nwould show Lionel Hammerton what a mistake he had made when he sported\\r\\nwith the deep feelings of a girl like her.Meanwhile, Phœbe Somerton had insisted upon staying at the\\r\\nHall Farm. Her obstinacy upon this point had appeared at first to\\r\\ngive Amy a good deal of pain; but Phœbe explained that she had\\r\\nmarked out a line of conduct for herself as the line of duty under\\r\\nthe circumstances, and, whatever she might do in the future, at\\r\\npresent she would certainly live with her father and mother. Amy soon\\r\\nsaw that there was no pique in this, that it meant no ill feeling\\r\\ntowards herself, and the two girls understood each other well.[Pg 148] Amy was too much\\r\\nengrossed in her own scheme to let anything else trouble her.She had written to Paul Somerton a warm, affectionate letter, in\\r\\nwhich she had charged herself with his advancement in life; she had\\r\\nasked him to select his career, and insisted upon bearing all the\\r\\ncost of his studies and promotion. Paul had consulted his friend Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson, and had discussed the question with him in a hundred\\r\\ndifferent ways. He had for some time almost resolved upon declining\\r\\nthis proffered aid, but he knew that this would be hurtful in the\\r\\nextreme to Amy’s feelings, and Mr. Williamson argued the case so well,\\r\\nfrom a sisterly point of view, in favour of its acceptance that Paul\\r\\nbecomingly thanked his sometime sister, and left the point open for\\r\\nfurther consideration.Finally, Amy requested him to come to the Hall, and there she\\r\\nintroduced him to Earl Verner, and told his lordship the brief story\\r\\nof the lad’s life; and the end was, with the consent of Mrs. Somerton\\r\\nand Luke, that a commission in the army was[Pg 149] purchased for Paul, and he commenced his\\r\\nmilitary career as an ensign in the gallant Ninety-fifth, with fair\\r\\nprospects of rapid promotion.Mr. Williamson received a magnificent memento of his kindness\\r\\nto Paul in the shape of a watch exquisitely set with jewels, and a\\r\\ncourteous intimation that if Miss Tallant could at any time render Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson any service she would esteem it a delightful privilege to\\r\\nshow her high appreciation of his conduct.The barrister treasured her sweet-scented little note quite as\\r\\nmuch as he did the valuable jewelled watch, and he sighed and rubbed\\r\\nhis hands over the smouldering fire at his rooms when he heard of her\\r\\nforthcoming marriage.“She is such a splendid woman,” he would say. “I had almost\\r\\npersuaded myself that I was in love with her that first and only time\\r\\nwhen I saw her in town; and now that she is going to be married, by\\r\\nJove, I begin to think I really am in love with her.”But the truth is, Mr. Williamson had been hit[Pg 150] in early life. There was a mysterious,\\r\\nvague sort of story, which a few of his old friends sometimes told each\\r\\nother, concerning a romantic love affair,—a wedding, a separation and\\r\\ndeath, under very sad circumstances. Whatever the story was, nobody\\r\\never alluded to it in presence of Williamson; but they knew who knew\\r\\nhim that there was no likelihood of his falling in love again, or any\\r\\nnonsense of that sort, as others would put it. And the barrister had\\r\\nonly sighed at the mention of Amy’s marriage because a thought of his\\r\\nown love-dream and its terrible termination occurred to him at the\\r\\nmoment.Phœbe Somerton and Arthur Phillips were constantly together\\r\\nat the Hall Farm, and before the winter ended Arthur had summoned\\r\\nsufficient courage to discharge his heart’s load of love by a full and\\r\\nample confession; and Phœbe had looked into his great dark eyes,\\r\\nand responded to his vows with all the frankness and innocent truth of\\r\\nMiranda herself.Thus Arthur was in the sunny path of his existence at last, and he\\r\\nseemed to become a new being under the influence of his happiness.Luke Somerton and his wife were calm spectators of all these\\r\\nchanges, and meanwhile they had their own little schemes for the\\r\\nfuture. There was a certain farm in the Lincolnshire fens which Mrs.\\r\\nSomerton had known as a girl, and which, from inquiries that Luke had\\r\\nmade, was likely to be “To Let.” There were no more fertile pastures\\r\\nthan those which surrounded it in all the fen country, not a pleasanter\\r\\nhouse and garden, no better shooting than was to be had close by, and\\r\\nwith the advantage of being near an important town, and not far from a\\r\\nrailway station.Luke and his wife had calculated the prospects of settling down in\\r\\ntheir own native county, and the bailiff was full of plans and schemes,\\r\\nwhich were an everlasting source of pleasant, hopeful talk.All this time Richard Tallant was up to his neck in the great game\\r\\nof financial speculation,[Pg\\r\\n152] and rumour had over and over again predicted his downfall.\\r\\nThe Eastern Bank, notwithstanding his father’s noble contribution\\r\\ntowards its shaken capital, had failed. The Indian branches had\\r\\nsuffered serious losses, and the retirement of Mr. Tallant from the\\r\\ndirectory had led to other resignations, and Stock Exchange rumours had\\r\\neventually shaken the confidence of depositors and others, and the Bank\\r\\nwent to the wall. The Meter Iron Works continued to flourish, but with\\r\\ndiminished dividends and gradually falling stock.Mr. Tallant had been mixed up with some of the greatest failures\\r\\nof the day, and people said that by-and-by, when he really came to\\r\\nunderstand his own position, he would find himself insolvent; but\\r\\npeople said this about dozens of others whose possessions had not even\\r\\nbeen shaken in the panic, and who could show a bonâ fide income\\r\\nof many thousands a year from real property.What did Richard Tallant care for all this?[Pg 153] Nothing, so far as the world could\\r\\njudge; but it made him irritable and ill-tempered in his own house.\\r\\nHis valet could have told you a good deal about this, and so could the\\r\\nservants; but to the outside world, whatever else he might be, he was\\r\\na straightforward, independent, good-tempered fellow. There were those\\r\\nwho said this was all “put on,” and that he was a designing sneak; but\\r\\nhis high-stepping horses and his splendid dinners soon silenced these\\r\\ndoubtful ones, whom the great man entertained for that purpose only,\\r\\ncursing them in his heart whilst he smiled upon them and called them\\r\\nfriends.Mr. and Mrs. Dibble had returned together to London, to their\\r\\nlittle lodging-house at Pimlico, but by no means to live a happy life;\\r\\nfor Dibble had been persuaded to lend the showman fifty pounds the\\r\\nmorning after that introduction at Severntown, and the money had been\\r\\nlost irretrievably; for within a fortnight afterwards Digby Martin\\r\\nhad presented himself at their house a ruined, ragged, dissipated\\r\\nfellow.His daughter had eloped with some vagabond, and left him; business\\r\\nhad waned from that moment until it dwindled away almost to nothing.\\r\\nThe skeleton had declined to enter into the proposed contract, and\\r\\nhis “traps” had been sold to pay the rent of the ground at the “Blue\\r\\nPosts.” He had walked all the way to London, friendless and a beggar,\\r\\nhis only means of subsistence being in the money earned by Momus. The\\r\\ndawg, he said, had behaved like a Christian to him, and he was sure his\\r\\nfriend Dibble would do no less, considering how Dibble had been treated\\r\\nin the palmy days of the Temple.This was all very well, and Mrs. Dibble would perhaps not have\\r\\ncomplained had the showman taken his departure after the first visit,\\r\\nand not presented himself for renewed charity; but he came again and\\r\\nagain, and Mrs. Dibble and her husband had serious disagreements about\\r\\nit. The lodgers were scandalised at the visits of this low person and\\r\\nhis dawg, and one of them had given up his rooms at a day’s notice\\r\\nbecause he had[Pg 155] seen\\r\\nthis friend of Dibble’s going through a performance with his dog, and\\r\\nbegging coppers, in a back street.Dibble had appealed to the showman to leave the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nhad bribed him too. But Digby Martin, alias Digger, alias\\r\\nSmith, knew a trick worth two of that. He only spent the bribe in\\r\\ndrink, and came back to Still Street and abused Mrs. Dibble for being\\r\\nproud and stuck up.To think that she should come to this, with her boarding-school\\r\\neducation and her semi-architectural contracting father; it was a blow\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Dibble could not possibly have dreamed of, and she upbraided\\r\\nherself for her weakness in following Dibble and releasing him from his\\r\\ndegraded position.“He never asked you, marm,” said the showman, with a drunken leer.\\r\\n“It wash not our wish you should come and sheek ush out—you old\\r\\ncatamaran!”“Catamaran!” exclaimed Mrs. Dibble, dashing[Pg 156] the tears from her eyes.\\r\\n“Catamaran!—Dibble, if you don’t punch that breuth head I will—so\\r\\nthere!”“Then I must do it, I suppose,” said Dibble. “Now, look’e ’ere,\\r\\nfriend,” said Dibble; “I baint goin’ to stand any more o’ this; so\\r\\nclear out.”“Dy’e hear that, Momush?” said the showman; “we’re to clear\\r\\nout,” and thereupon the drunken magician prepared for the coming\\r\\nengagement.There was the shank-end of a leg of mutton on the table. Dibble,\\r\\nnodding to his wife to make her comprehend his plan, took up the\\r\\nbone and held it to the “dawg’s” nose. Momus immediately stood upon\\r\\nher hind-legs and followed Dibble to the back kitchen, where she was\\r\\nspeedily locked in with her supper.The showman, hardly comprehending this scheme for removing the\\r\\nprotector, by whose side he was so valiant, darted towards the door\\r\\nbefore Dibble had time to turn round; but not before Mrs. Dibble had\\r\\ntime to insert her arm between the drunkard and Dibble, the result of\\r\\nwhich was[Pg 157] that the\\r\\nmagician rolled over, and Dibble was saved the pain and trouble of\\r\\nknocking his old friend down himself.It was an easy matter to put the showman into the street after\\r\\nthis, and when a policeman came up Momus was let out, to walk on her\\r\\nhind-legs, by the side of the man in blue.A facetious reporter at the police court the next day made a funny\\r\\nparagraph out of the showman’s appearance, the magistrate having\\r\\nrequested the “dawg” to be brought into court. Momus made a bow to the\\r\\nbench, and stood upon her hind-legs; which put the magistrate in such a\\r\\ngood humour, that he let off the showman with a caution.The incident was anything but a funny one to the Dibbles, for they\\r\\nlost their lodgers, and Mrs. Dibble lost her respectability and her\\r\\ncontrol of the street; so she gave vent to her feelings by upbraiding\\r\\nThomas, and the end was that they were exceedingly miserable, and Mrs.\\r\\nDibble[Pg 158] talked of\\r\\na “judicious separation,” which was a thing that her “wortht dreamth\\r\\nhad never brought to her mind; and oh! if her poor father could only\\r\\nrithe and thee her!” Poor Dibble, he could think of nothing but getting\\r\\ninto the Thames, or thrusting his head into the water-butt. He thought\\r\\nbetter of this by-and-by, however; but not until he had looked at\\r\\nthe Thames by gas-light and dipped his head a little way into the\\r\\nwater-butt. If the water had not been so cold, we believe Dibble would\\r\\nhave put his head deeper into it; but, oh, it was so very cold!Meanwhile Mr. Jefferson Crawley, alias Shuffleton Gibbs, and\\r\\nthe showman’s daughter, were spending their honeymoon, and the ex-swell\\r\\nwas educating the young lady, and introducing her into a new world.“I want you to come and spend a week with me, Phœbe,” said\\r\\nthe Miss Tallant to the young lady who had abdicated.They had met near Barton Hall, each on a morning’s ramble in the\\r\\npark, the spring sunshine was so tempting.“Mother is not well,” said Phœbe, hesitatingly; “and father is\\r\\nso busy just now in negotiations for a new farm in Lincolnshire.”At first blush it almost seemed as if there were a little\\r\\naffectation in this careful mention of her new position, and\\r\\nthe display of duty, on Phœbe’s[Pg 160] part; but it was not so. Phœbe had\\r\\nargued out her duty, had reasoned with herself upon the course which\\r\\nshe ought to pursue; she had prayed earnestly, and religiously striven\\r\\nto see aright, and the end was that she determined to act her part\\r\\nas became a dutiful child. It was not for her to judge her mother’s\\r\\nconduct, nor to repine at her change of fortune. If she had lost wealth\\r\\nand station, she had found a mother and father, and she had obtained\\r\\nthereby perfect freedom in the expression of her love for Arthur\\r\\nPhillips.On the whole, then, Phœbe’s real happiness had rather been\\r\\nenhanced by the discovery that she was not the wealthy Christopher\\r\\nTallant’s daughter. A certain feeling of regret would make itself\\r\\nmanifest to her now and then when she remembered the luxuries of the\\r\\nHall, the charming books, the pictures, the familiar boudoir, with its\\r\\ndainty furniture; but this feeling was soon followed by a remembrance\\r\\nof the vague sense of loneliness which often afflicted her there, and\\r\\nthe consciousness of being neglected by her[Pg 161] father. Though there had been scarcely\\r\\na wish that she could not gratify, so far as money was concerned, her\\r\\nlife had not been altogether a happy one; it was calm and peaceful, but\\r\\nthere had seemed to be no motive in it.Now all this was changed. Duty had stepped in between herself and\\r\\nthe world. “Honour thy father and thy mother” was a commandment which\\r\\nhad a new meaning for her. A certain amount of self-sacrifice seemed to\\r\\nbe involved, and she made it cheerfully. And all the time she loved the\\r\\nlandscape painter.Phœbe’s was not the love which Amy had felt for Lionel\\r\\nHammerton; it was not that mad, passionate, doubting, hopeless,\\r\\nlonging love, which often animates the heart that is fixed upon one\\r\\nof high rank and station; it was not the love of the lowly maiden\\r\\nfor the prince, whom she feels that she lowers by her very passion;\\r\\nit was not the almost fanatical looking upwards of idol-worship; but\\r\\nthe love which feels itself worthy of the thing it loves—the love of\\r\\nequals, the passion which has[Pg\\r\\n162] no worldly fears of rank intervening, the love that dreams\\r\\nnot for a moment of condescension on either hand, the love that levels\\r\\nby its intense nobleness and generosity the king with his subject, the\\r\\nnoble-born with the peasant, the rich with the poor.Amy had loved humbly and meekly, but still with a burning passion;\\r\\nshe had looked up to Lionel Hammerton as one afar off, and she could\\r\\nhave suffered for him in any fashion, and been his slave; he might\\r\\nhave commanded her in almost all things. And when he raised her up\\r\\nand whispered in her ear the love he bore her, she had gone home and\\r\\ncried tears of joy and gratitude; but being raised, as it were, to his\\r\\nside, she could not bear indifference, and all her latent pride had\\r\\ncome to her aid when the most generous constructions she could put upon\\r\\nLionel’s conduct only led her to feel that she had been designedly\\r\\nslighted. Her woman’s instinct had begun to interpret his attentions\\r\\ninto mere flirtation sometime before he had so suddenly left the\\r\\ncountry.[Pg 163] After that\\r\\nday when he had whispered his admiration so earnestly, and sealed his\\r\\nwords with a kiss, he had never called at the Hall or the farm. She had\\r\\nlearnt that he had been at home several times prior to his departure,\\r\\nand that he had been at Avonworth, too; but he had made no sign to her.\\r\\nThis was not love, she knew. The lover, whose mistress has hung upon\\r\\nhis tender words, and told him by a thousand endearing glances how\\r\\nfervently his love is returned, loses no opportunity of enjoying the\\r\\nsweets of courtship. Lionel Hammerton had been near Barton, and Amy\\r\\nhad sighed for his presence—had longed to look upon him—had counted\\r\\nthe hours and days since she saw him last; yet he came not. And then\\r\\nhe left the country, deeming her unworthy of a parting word. Had he\\r\\nsent her some letter which had miscarried? No. Had he left any message\\r\\nfor her with his friend, Arthur Phillips? No. On the contrary, he had\\r\\nspoken of her, not as Arthur would like to have had his sister spoken\\r\\nof, before he left on that long journey, which was, no doubt,[Pg 164] intended to make a gulf\\r\\nbetween them that should separate them for ever.Lionel had flirted with her, and left her with indifference, perhaps\\r\\nwith contempt, and the native pride of her mother asserted itself, and\\r\\nrevenge had filled up the place which love had occupied.“Yes,” said Phœbe. “We will first call at the farm, and let\\r\\nmother know,” said Phœbe. “I know she will be pleased for me to\\r\\ngo with you, and I can go and see them every day.”“Oh, yes, child; but how very dutiful you are, to be sure: more so\\r\\nthan I was, I fear,” said Amy, just a little impatiently.The spring sunshine streamed upon them as they walked, like a\\r\\nbenediction from heaven. The trees were tipped with brown and green;\\r\\nsome shone like frosted silver, and others looked like mere outlines\\r\\nagainst the sky, as if nature had just sketched them, and left them in\\r\\noutline. The lake shone with a clear bright radiance, and reflected\\r\\nitself full of the adjacent hill, and you could look down into it and\\r\\nsee a picture of surpassing beauty, now and then veiled for a moment by\\r\\npassing clouds that made great flitting shadows over the green turf,\\r\\ntoo, and seemed to chase each other, like the birds that were building\\r\\ntheir nests.Phœbe felt all the delightful sensations of the time; she\\r\\nstepped aside when her foot threatened the daisy just peeping forth\\r\\namongst the tender grass; she felt the warm breath of the genius of\\r\\nthe time upon her cheek, the bleating of the lambs awakened gentle\\r\\nsympathetic emotions within her, and she shared in the general hope of\\r\\ncreation at the return of the gracious season.Poor Amy had fixed up an entirely worldly standard for her hopes and\\r\\nfears; a standard that was but little influenced by any feelings such\\r\\nas those which animated her companion. The life-giving spirit of the\\r\\nseason only animated Amy with fresh vigour in the prosecution of her\\r\\nplans, and with a more lively animation in carrying out the magnificent\\r\\nscheme of revenge and self-justification.It was a tremendous question, but it was answered at last, by the\\r\\naid of a multifarious collection of patterns of materials, and the\\r\\nwritten opinion of a French modiste who was coming down from\\r\\ntown to wait upon Earl Verner’s intended wife.Then questions about bridesmaids were discussed, and the pedigrees\\r\\nof several of the earl’s lady relatives, who were to take part in the\\r\\nceremony, were hunted up in the Peerage.“Of course you will be one of them, my dear,”[Pg 167] said Amy, “and the prettiest of all, I\\r\\ndare be bound.”“I shall think you do not love me at all, if you decline; his\\r\\nlordship shall ask you himself if you will not say yes to my\\r\\nrequest.”“But you are soaring so far above me,” said Phœbe, in her\\r\\nquiet gentle way. “I shall feel out of place amongst such great\\r\\npeople.”“Nonsense! beauty shall rank with the highest of them that day,”\\r\\nsaid Amy, proudly. “Nay, do not blush; you know I would not flatter\\r\\nyou.”“You are so changed,” said Phœbe, thoughtfully. “I seem to\\r\\nremember you as one belonging to the past, Amy; and it has often made\\r\\nme feel very sad.”“Think differently about it,” said Amy, assuming a light, gay tone.\\r\\n“I know I am changed, but changed for the better. I have dropped out of\\r\\nmy bundle of feelings a parcel[Pg\\r\\n168] called sensibility, or sensitiveness, or something of that\\r\\nkind, Phœbe, and I am glad of it. I find myself in a world where\\r\\nit is inconvenient to have fine feelings, and I have resolved to take\\r\\nthe world as I find it.”Amy was discomposed for a moment at the suggestion; but she\\r\\nrecovered her self-possession very speedily.“You are thinking of what I told you in the summer-house, in that\\r\\npast time of which you have spoken.”“I knew you were. Well, Phœbe, that belongs to the past;\\r\\nLionel Hammerton belongs to the past—to my past; he has no place in my\\r\\nfuture.”Amy said this solemnly, and with a fierce kind of firmness in her\\r\\nmanner, which told Phœbe how much revengeful feeling there was in\\r\\nthe change that had come over the new mistress of Barton Hall.“There is no ‘but’ in the case, love; he shall have indifference\\r\\nfor indifference, scorn for scorn, and I will trample upon all his\\r\\nworldly hopes as the Countess of Verner, as he trampled upon mine as\\r\\nthe Honourable Lionel Hammerton.”Amy rose from her seat when she said this, and planted her pretty\\r\\nfeet upon the ground with calm determination.“You loved beneath your station, as some would hold, my dear,” said\\r\\nAmy. “I loved above mine:[Pg\\r\\n170] it is the way of the world: the highest may stoop to the\\r\\nlowest, or trifle with the love that is offered. Fate or Providence, as\\r\\nyou would say, has wrought a wonderful change in our lots, has reversed\\r\\nour positions, and just at the proper moment. By placing you a little\\r\\nlower, as far as worldly considerations are concerned, Fate has brought\\r\\nyou nearer to him you love, and brought hopes of future happiness. My\\r\\nexaltation has given me the power for self-assertion, for blotting out\\r\\na silly passion, granting me, almost at the moment when I prayed for\\r\\nit, the dearest wish of my heart. That carriage with the coronet in the\\r\\npanel, whirling along through the autumn leaves, was the omen—the sign\\r\\nwhich Fate flung before me. I accepted it, and I shall not turn back;\\r\\nno, I shall not turn back.”Phœbe blushed at the mention of her own love, and pitied\\r\\nAmy, knowing how she too had loved in those past days; but she could\\r\\ngive Amy no soothing tidings of Lionel; she could not deny that\\r\\nhis conduct had been unmanly, and somewhat[Pg 171] dishonourable. Yet Arthur Phillips had\\r\\nnot told her of those last words of Lionel’s, nor had he shown her\\r\\na letter since received from him, in which Mr. Hammerton said “that\\r\\nstupid bit of flirtation in Avonworth Valley” he hoped was forgotten\\r\\nby the bailiff’s pretty daughter, “who had played her part so well and\\r\\nvery nearly with success.” Phœbe could not help feeling that some\\r\\nmisunderstanding, some mistake or other, had come between the loves of\\r\\nthese two, and she would fain have pointed this out to Amy.“Don’t speak of it, Phœbe, love,—I have thought of that and\\r\\neverything, and have resolved. Beside, my love, it is not fitting we\\r\\nshould discuss the question. I am betrothed; in a few short weeks I\\r\\nshall be a wife.”“It is because you have those few weeks in which you might still\\r\\nchange your determination that I venture to ask you, supposing[Pg 172] Lionel Hammerton were to\\r\\nreturn and renew his former attentions, and offer you marriage,” said\\r\\nPhœbe.“I should not believe in his sincerity,—I would rather be beyond his\\r\\nreach. I could fain hope that he might feel a passion for me, that he\\r\\nmight all of a sudden love me; that he might feel some of the pangs I\\r\\nhave felt. No, Phœbe, if he were at my feet this moment I might\\r\\nsmile and let him sue; but I should not love him,—I should not prefer\\r\\nhim to his elder brother with the title;—oh, no! all that romantic\\r\\nsentiment is over!—I should prefer to be a countess in possession\\r\\nrather than in reversion. And now we have said enough about this. I\\r\\nwanted to talk to you and ask you all sorts of questions, and you\\r\\nhave literally turned the tables upon me by putting me through a most\\r\\nromantic catechism. I have answered you to the best of my ability and\\r\\nwith perfect sincerity; so now, pray, be content, and let us talk of\\r\\nlaces, and ribbons, and orange blossoms, and glacé, and poult\\r\\nde soie; of bridesmaids,[Pg\\r\\n173] and Hanover Square, and matrimonial responsibilities.”And Amy rattled away and laughed at Phœbe’s sober face, and\\r\\nkissed her fair forehead, as joyously as if she were about to marry her\\r\\nfirst love; but when she was alone in her bedroom, she flung herself\\r\\ndown and sobbed aloud.Why had heaven given her all those warm passions, that deep capacity\\r\\nto love, and set the idol before her, and let all her love go for\\r\\nnaught? This was the burden of the burning thoughts which Phœbe’s\\r\\nconversation had aroused.It is questionable whether Byron really knew in his soul much about\\r\\nthe true and pure love of woman, though he has described its dangerous\\r\\nand passionate phases so well. It is a lovely and a dangerous thing,\\r\\nundescribable and unfathomable. “All that has been written in song, or\\r\\ntold in story, of love and its effects, falls far short of its[Pg 174] reality. Its evils and\\r\\nits blessings, its impotence and its power, its sin and its holiness,\\r\\nits weakness and its strength, will continue the theme of nature and of\\r\\nart, until the great pulse of the universe is stilled.”O, how she had loved this man! And he knew it! Here was the bitter\\r\\nsting that wounded the poor, stricken woman; that stirred all her\\r\\nwoman’s pride, and made her almost hate herself that she had confessed\\r\\nso much—made her hate him, or fancy she hated him, the more for having\\r\\nwiled her secret from her.Love, jealousy, pride, and woman’s modesty, all seemed to pronounce\\r\\nin her mind against the man whom she had loved so wildly; and Pride\\r\\ninflicted the fiercest pangs of all in the woman’s wounded sense of\\r\\nunrequited Love.During Phœbe’s visit to her old home, Lord Verner called\\r\\ntwice. His lordship was particularly gracious, and evidently deeply\\r\\nenamoured of Amy.When he came Amy was careful to put on her best smiles. It seemed to\\r\\nPhœbe as if she delighted in watching the effect of her little\\r\\nsallies of pleasantry and wit upon the love-sick earl. She humoured\\r\\nand petted him in her conversation, and at the same time triumphed\\r\\nover him. She seemed to give way to all his whims, and yet had her own\\r\\nway.His lordship had at first been all anxiety that the marriage should\\r\\nbe particularly quiet, and[Pg\\r\\n176] Amy had appeared to enter into his plans in this respect;\\r\\nbut now he was for all sorts of extravagant demonstration, and Amy led\\r\\nhim on so far, that it would be impossible to give up any important\\r\\npoints in the general display.And she looked so fresh, and bright, and happy in his love, and Lord\\r\\nVerner appeared to be so proud of her, that Phœbe almost began to\\r\\nbelieve that happiness would come of the union.No one could say that Amy would not fill her high station so far\\r\\nas appearance, and carriage, and manners were concerned. She looked\\r\\nevery inch a countess already. And she knew it; for she took all manner\\r\\nof pains to set off her graceful, well defined figure. Dainty robes\\r\\nof well studied colour to throw up her clear, but dark complexion;\\r\\nscarlet bands in her black hair, with a simple diamond star that did\\r\\nnot sparkle more brightly than her own bright eyes. Pretty ruffles on\\r\\nher wrists, and about her neck, and dainty shoes upon her feet, that\\r\\nnow and then peeped forth from beneath her embroidered petticoat;[Pg 177] she had a powerful\\r\\nfascination for Earl Verner. She seemed to be unconscious of her\\r\\ncharms, and this made her doubly attractive.What would his lordship have said if he could have overheard that\\r\\nconversation between his betrothed and her friend with the sweet\\r\\nMiranda face? He would not have been more surprised, we suspect, than\\r\\nMr. Lionel Hammerton, who was in India all this time, blissfully\\r\\nignorant of all that was going on at Barton,—blissfully ignorant of the\\r\\nrecent changes. If any one had told him that his thorough-going old\\r\\nbachelor brother was engaged to be married, he would have treated it as\\r\\na good joke. And supposing the gossip had supplemented that statement\\r\\nwith a true history of the case, he would have given him considerable\\r\\ncredit for imagination, and pooh-poohed the whole thing.Amy Somerton discovered to be Christopher Tallant’s daughter, and\\r\\nMiss Tallant no other than the bailiff’s daughter!—changed in infancy\\r\\nby the bailiff’s wife! Old Tallant dead, and made Amy his heiress, cut\\r\\noff his son, not even with a[Pg\\r\\n178] shilling. And Earl Verner going to marry the young lady\\r\\nthat Lionel had flirted with, and whose likeness was hung outside those\\r\\nmosquito curtains! Of course he would not have believed a word of it.\\r\\nHe would more readily have accepted the incidents in the novel he had\\r\\nbeen reading than these. Besides, who could be expected to believe that\\r\\nthose two girls had been changed in their cradles? It was such an old\\r\\nstory, that; all very well in a poem or a romance, but it could never\\r\\noccur in the Vale of Avonworth.Perhaps, chers amis, you, too, may think in this wise. The\\r\\nidea is not a new one, we must confess; but if it is a fact, you will\\r\\naccept it as worthy of record, not for its own sake, but on account\\r\\nof the consequences arising out of Mrs. Somerton’s mistaken ambition.\\r\\nRemember, friends, there is no new thing under the sun. We have this\\r\\nupon the authority of the wisest of all men, and the preacher is\\r\\nverified in ten thousand ways. As far back as the thirteenth century\\r\\none Friar Bacon, probably writing upon facts and[Pg 179] traditions handed down from times long\\r\\nantecedent to his own day, anticipated in his works the railway,\\r\\nthe steamship, the hydraulic engine, and the balloon. The Chinese\\r\\nwere printers before the ancient Romans discovered Britain, and\\r\\nthe Romans made gunpowder when there were naked savages living in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood of Barton Hall. The Chinese had discovered gas\\r\\nlong before we knew anything about it. Chloroform, photography, the\\r\\ntelegraph, and a hundred other “new” inventions, were old things used\\r\\nand forgotten before we heard of them. Have not all the finest thoughts\\r\\nthat can enter the brain of scholar or poet been thought before? and\\r\\ndoes not some classical writer anathematise the great men who had\\r\\nsaid all the good things before him? All that long race of thinkers\\r\\nand writers, and poets and orators, and tale-tellers and humourists,\\r\\nand playwrights,—what room have they left for a mere story-teller to\\r\\ninterest and say something new?“There is nothing new under the sun.” But[Pg 180] there ought to be something new\\r\\nin a novel, nevertheless, most readers seem to think. Critical\\r\\nreaders claim something new at the novelist’s hands, and rate him\\r\\n and he dare to walk in beaten tracks. Next to\\r\\nsomething new comes something true. This shall protect our neck from\\r\\nthe sharp edge of the sword that hangs by that Damoclean thread which\\r\\nis so easily severed. We are telling a tale with Truth for its basis,\\r\\nand how can the mere historian help it if there is nothing new in one\\r\\nof the main incidents of his narrative? Human hopes and fears, and\\r\\nsorrows and troubles, and joys and pleasures, are a constant repetition\\r\\nof the same occurrences, and love of money forms the axis upon which\\r\\nthis world of trouble revolves.When you tell your favourite little stories after dinner—incidents\\r\\nin your own life—you don’t think there is nothing new under the sun\\r\\nthen—eh? “New or not, they are true,” you say. Very well, sir, and so\\r\\nis this history; and if there is one part of it more truthful than\\r\\nanother, it is that quiet but important bit of exchange performed\\r\\nin[Pg 181] those early days\\r\\nof those charming young women, who used to live like sisters at Barton\\r\\nHall. Ask old Dibble if this is not a true story; ask Arthur Phillips\\r\\nand his wife; ask the Right Hon. the Countess of Verner; go down to\\r\\nAvonworth, and visit Barton Hall.Lionel Hammerton would not have believed it, nevertheless, and he\\r\\nwill return from India utterly ignorant of all the changes that have\\r\\ntaken place up to this period of our story; for those two letters\\r\\nwritten by a certain painter, and the one sealed with a coronet, are\\r\\ndestined to pass their owner on the high seas, both travelling in\\r\\ndifferent directions.If Lord Verner would have been very much surprised could he have\\r\\nheard that conversation between the two ladies at Barton Hall, what\\r\\nwould he have thought of the following dialogue, which was spoken a few\\r\\ndays afterwards.“I must confess I am a little surprised,” said Miss Tallant, “that\\r\\nyou should not have given me notice of your visit.”“It did not occur to me that such a measure was needful from a\\r\\nbrother to his sister,” said Mr. Richard Tallant, coolly throwing\\r\\nhimself into an easy chair.“Brother and sister, truly,” said Miss Tallant, with dignity, “but\\r\\nhitherto somewhat divided in feeling and opinion, and latterly by a\\r\\nlaw-suit.”“Yes, these things will occur; but you possess rather more than your\\r\\nshare, my sister, of our father’s goods. Would it have been otherwise\\r\\nthan fair to have given the son and heir half the property?”“Would it not have been brotherly to give the sister an opportunity\\r\\nat least to consider what course she should take before loading her\\r\\nwith threats, and commencing an action against her in Chancery?” said\\r\\nMiss Tallant. “The wishes of the dead are entitled to respect, and\\r\\nespecially with regard to property left behind for others; but the\\r\\nrecipient of a fortune such as that which I have inherited could have\\r\\nafforded to be generous, and would have endeavoured, no doubt,[Pg 183] to give effect to the\\r\\nimpulses of her own heart, even in the interest of one who did not\\r\\ndeserve compassion.”“Indeed!” said Richard; “you are quite eloquent, I declare. You fill\\r\\nyour high station magnificently. May I ring for luncheon?”“Perhaps it would be a little more courteous in the first place\\r\\nto explain your business, and in the next to leave the ordering of\\r\\nluncheon to the mistress of the house.”“As you please,” said Mr. Tallant—“as you please. I want you to\\r\\ninstruct Twyzell and Kits, your lawyers, to pay four thousand pounds to\\r\\nmy credit to-morrow.”“Yes, I will be frank with you. Certain important securities which\\r\\nI hold have suddenly fallen in value, and a banking friend of mine who\\r\\nholds them is anxious that the sum which they did represent should be\\r\\nmade up in cash; I am very desirous of obliging my friend, and I knew\\r\\nyou would oblige me.”“Indeed,” repeated Miss Tallant, “I fear I must refer you to the\\r\\ngentlemen whom you have mentioned; your legal process has quite removed\\r\\nthe affair beyond the pale of my consideration, whatever my feelings\\r\\nwith regard to it might be.”“Indeed!” said Mr. Richard Tallant, altogether uninfluenced by the\\r\\nquiet, sarcastic smile which played round Miss Tallant’s mouth, and\\r\\nignoring altogether the evident annoyance which his effrontery excited,\\r\\nand which Amy struggled unsuccessfully to hide.“It may not be mine to lend; you have threatened to upset your\\r\\nfather’s will, and your lawyer professes to be certain that you can\\r\\nsucceed in doing so. I must refer you to Mr. Twyzell; and now I will\\r\\norder luncheon for you,” said Amy, advancing towards the bell.“Stay one moment,” said Richard, stroking his beard, in which\\r\\nalready there were many grey hairs; “it is useless to refer me to\\r\\nTwyzell; you[Pg 185] must\\r\\nwrite a note requesting him to let me have the money to-morrow. He\\r\\nmay lend it me without prejudice, as the lawyers say, so that it will\\r\\nin nowise influence any legal proceedings that are pending. You must\\r\\ndo this, or I shall be compelled to say something very unpleasant. I\\r\\ncannot possibly do without the money, and it is most convenient that\\r\\nyou should be the lender.”“What does this mean?” said Amy. “You know that I have no other\\r\\ncourse but to refer you to the lawyers, and it is idle to say more\\r\\nabout it.”“Very well; it is hard to force a gentleman and your brother, in\\r\\ndifficulties, to appear ungentlemanly and unbrotherly; but if he has no\\r\\nother resource, he must use means which he would otherwise reject with\\r\\ncontempt. You are to be married to the Right Hon. the Earl Verner, of\\r\\nMontem Castle; it is a great match.”“Do you remember a confession you once made—it is a long time ago\\r\\nnow—to the young[Pg 186]\\r\\nlady who was Miss Tallant then and your patroness.”The questioner looked up to his sister to note the effect of his\\r\\ninterrogation; but there was no change in Amy’s face, though she began\\r\\nto suspect why her visitor had exercised so much assumption of power\\r\\nand authority in this unexpected interview.“You were sitting together in the summer-house yonder on a spring\\r\\nmorning not unlike the present, and you entered into some very\\r\\ninteresting details with regard to myself, and also concerning your\\r\\nlove, or fancy, or liking, or whatever it is called, for Earl Verner’s\\r\\nbrother.”Amy did not lose her self-control even at this point of the\\r\\nconversation; but she remembered the time to which he alluded, and\\r\\nremembered it vividly, for she had always believed that Richard\\r\\nTallant had overheard all she and Phœbe said on that particular\\r\\noccasion.“No, that was not necessary,” said Mr. Tallant; “the door was open a\\r\\nlittle way, and two voices forced themselves upon my attention—that is\\r\\nthe courteous way of putting it.”“It occurred to me that you might spare me the pain of proceeding\\r\\nfurther, and that you would write to Twyzell and Kits at once.”“Since the subject is becoming interesting at last, I have no desire\\r\\nto put an end to it now,” said Amy, who had some little time previously\\r\\nsat down, with the table between herself and her visitor.“Earl Verner would hardly like to hear that you were passionately in\\r\\nlove with his brother, and that his brother had jilted the woman he is\\r\\nabout to marry; besides, he is a generous fellow—he might give the lady\\r\\nup to her first love, and particularly as he is invalided sometimes\\r\\nand fond of a quiet life. I have business with his lordship[Pg 188] and thought of riding\\r\\nover this afternoon, if you could lend me a horse.”It was a desperate struggle for Amy to sit still and endure this; the\\r\\ncolour came and went in her cheeks, and her heart beat at a fever rate,\\r\\nand then seemed to stop altogether; but still she sat in her chair,\\r\\nand gave but slight indication of the sharpness of the poisoned shafts\\r\\nwhich made such a sensible impression upon her. The humiliation of\\r\\nbargaining for the maintenance of a secret from her husband—a secret\\r\\nthat might possibly break off an alliance which she had done so much to\\r\\nencompass. But he would not believe it? And if he did, she could tell\\r\\nhim that all that silly passion was at an end. These thoughts passed\\r\\nthrough her mind much more rapidly than the printer’s type has conveyed\\r\\nthem to the reader; but she made no sign.“Shall I ride over to Montem, or return to town? If I go to town you\\r\\nwill hear no more from me, at all events until the marriage is over,\\r\\nunless you would like me to give you away.”This was another sting; it reminded Amy of her helpless and forlorn\\r\\nposition, and as she glanced at the fine manly form of her brother,\\r\\na pang of honest regret that they were so fearfully sundered, shot\\r\\nthrough her heart, and almost brought the tears into her eyes.“I think we understand each other,” said Mr. Tallant, as though this\\r\\nsuspense made him uncomfortable.It required no considerable effort for Amy to maintain her calmness,\\r\\nthough she had lately set up in her own way for a very clever actress;\\r\\nbut she did not break down. She rang the bell, ordered luncheon for Mr.\\r\\nRichard Tallant, and desiring that gentleman to give her half an hour\\r\\nto consider his request, withdrew and sought her own room.“Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Richard Tallant when she had gone, “a\\r\\ndevilish good fight she made of it: there’s no mistake about her\\r\\nparentage;[Pg 190] if\\r\\nanything had been wanting to prove our relationship, this interview\\r\\nwould clinch it.”Mr. Tallant thereupon walked up to the mantel-piece, contemplated\\r\\nhimself, stroked his beard, and apostrophised his counterfeit.“You must be an infernal blackguard, Richard Tallant, Esq., to work\\r\\nsuch an infernal scheme as this against a woman! Upon my soul I believe\\r\\nyou are a bad fellow, a deuced bad fellow. How is it, my friend, you\\r\\nare such a rascal? You had a fine opportunity once. I believe that\\r\\nthief Gibbs ruined you, eh? Perhaps; perhaps not. But you have been\\r\\nput to some tightish shifts, have you not, my friend, none tighter\\r\\nthan this? When a fellow can see his way out of certain ruin by a bit\\r\\nof meanness, or whatever you like to call it, the temptation is very\\r\\ngreat—is it not? Ha, well, it’s a wicked world, a wicked world. You\\r\\nought to have been the proprietor of this place, my friend: well, never\\r\\nmind; you must manage to do with a part of it, eh? Yes, with a part of\\r\\nit: half a loaf, you know.”“Half a loaf did you say?” asked the quick-eared servant who had\\r\\njust entered with a tray. “Yes, sir—white or brown?”And the son of the dead merchant commenced his luncheon. Before he\\r\\nhad finished, the same servant brought him a note from Miss Tallant,\\r\\nwhich enclosed a letter to Twyzell and Kits.“That’s all right,” he said to himself; “give my love to Miss\\r\\nTallant, say I am greatly obliged to her, and that she need not give\\r\\nherself any further trouble in the matter.”Poor Amy! She had not counted upon this new feature of difficulty\\r\\nin her scheme of ambition and revenge. But she was resolved that\\r\\nnothing should frustrate the accomplishment of the whole scheme which\\r\\nshe had planned[Pg 192]\\r\\nout. She was betrothed to Lord Verner, and she would marry him at any\\r\\nsacrifice, ay, even to standing at the altar with Mr. Richard Tallant\\r\\nin the paternal and brotherly position he had mentioned. It was rather\\r\\nsingular that Richard Tallant as he returned to town that day should\\r\\nhave thought so much about this same contingency.“Why should I not be one of the wedding guests?” he said, as he\\r\\nsmoked and waited for the next train at Orford Junction. “Why should I\\r\\nnot give her away?”And these were the happy days of the courtship of Phœbe and\\r\\nArthur. They came with the spring blossoms, opening up a bright new\\r\\nfuture to both.Yes, happy days, perfectly happy. Philosophy says there is no\\r\\nperfect happiness. Mr. Williamson would smile with quiet amazement at\\r\\nyour simplicity if you held that anybody had been perfectly happy, even\\r\\nfor an hour. But then, you know, he had been hit in his early days, and\\r\\nthe remembrance of his own transient approach to a sense of happiness\\r\\nmay have embittered his later existence.Arthur Phillips, a year ago, would have entered into an abstract\\r\\nargument with you upon the subject. He would have told you, with\\r\\nGuizot, that[Pg 194] the\\r\\nstudy of art perhaps contained the highest elements of happiness; that,\\r\\nin the abstract, it was altogether unconnected with the struggles\\r\\nand contests of ordinary life. Although he would have told you\\r\\nthat Guizot’s charming views about the study of art did not always\\r\\napply to the practice of it, he would have defended his opinion of\\r\\nthe unselfishness of a pure taste for the beautiful in art, and\\r\\ndemonstrated to you that it brought into play and had the power of\\r\\nexciting the deepest emotions, gratifying both the nobler and softer\\r\\nparts of our nature,—the imagination and the judgment, love of emotion\\r\\nand power of reflection, the enthusiasm and the critical faculty, the\\r\\nsenses and the reason;—but the painter would have sighed as he quoted\\r\\nthis enthusiastic commendation of art, and thought how far short all\\r\\nthis was from perfect happiness.To ramble about that old cathedral, to think of that dear, sweet\\r\\nface, was happiness; yet it left so much to long for and regret, that\\r\\nsometimes the pain was greater than the happiness.But as he sits beside that fair girl in the[Pg 195] farmer’s parlour, what does he think\\r\\nof happiness now? The philosopher says perfect happiness was never\\r\\nintended by the Deity to be the lot of man, but that He has given us\\r\\nthe power of an exceeding near approach to it. And we do not hesitate\\r\\nto say, that He does give to some mortals a foretaste of that perfect\\r\\nhappiness which is to be the undying prize of the future day.A wise lady, and a duchess, too, has said that our happiness in\\r\\nthis world depends on the affection we are enabled to inspire. Let\\r\\nPhœbe and Arthur be judged by this standard, and they are to\\r\\nbe envied indeed. To sit hand in hand, to walk and talk with freedom\\r\\nof their love, of the little incidents of past days, to recall their\\r\\nmoments of doubt, and look back to times of utter hopelessness, to\\r\\ntrace their little acts of sympathy from the first days of their love,\\r\\nto recall that grand festival beneath the cathedral roof, to think of\\r\\nthe days when each loved the other in secret and in fear and dread and\\r\\nin solitude! Was not this perfect happiness?Friend Greybeard, does not the old love break out afresh as you\\r\\ncontemplate two lovers like these? Don’t you remember the old dream? If\\r\\nthere is a picture in thy brain such as that of which sings the poet\\r\\nwhose scrap of rhyme, with an American name at the bottom, has just\\r\\nattracted my attention in the corner of the county newspaper, do not\\r\\nshut it out.The happiness of Arthur and Phœbe was something to look upon\\r\\nand be happy at. If Asmodeus had taken you to that model farm-house,\\r\\nthat you might have been a calm spectator of the love that had folded\\r\\nhis wings and settled down there beside that hearth, you would have\\r\\nbeen happier for the sight. For it was a catching happiness, that of\\r\\nPhœbe and Arthur; an epidemic of joy and bliss and peace. You\\r\\ncould not possibly have come within a yard of its influence without\\r\\nfeeling a certain delight. If you happened to be a young fellow, a\\r\\nslight touch of envy might, perhaps, have struggled into your heart\\r\\nand embittered the sight; for Phœbe might have struck you as the\\r\\nrealisation of all your dreams of beauty, so soft, and gentle, and\\r\\npulpy, and rosy, and innocent, and loving.We only meet with those beauties in books, you say, and in pictures.\\r\\nBut this is a common calumny upon English women. Such beauties as\\r\\nPhœbe[Pg 199]\\r\\nSomerton are rare, no doubt; but there are tender, kitten-like,\\r\\ninnocent, candid, pretty girls like her in many an English county.\\r\\nAy, and girls as good and true and generous. If our friend Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson were criticising this book for the\\r\\nPyrotechnic, he would probably say at this point that so far\\r\\nas the heroines are concerned, the male novelist usually describes\\r\\nhis characters as the perfection of beauty and goodness, impossibly\\r\\nlovely, impossibly true and generous; whilst the lady novelist combines\\r\\nbeauty with devilry, and makes her charming women fiends beyond the\\r\\nimagination of men; and as Mr. W. has a smart epigrammatic way of\\r\\nwriting, he would possibly say that whilst most men draw women as they\\r\\nought to be, most women depict them as they ought not to be, and the\\r\\npublic are waiting to see them painted as they are.We need not take the trouble to convince the Pyrotechnic that\\r\\nPhœbe Somerton is drawn to the life, if the Pyrotechnic\\r\\nthinks otherwise; but let us tell you, friendly reader, who has\\r\\naccompanied[Pg 200]\\r\\nus, paper-knife in hand, that Phœbe Somerton was all we have\\r\\ndescribed her in beauty and in gentleness and truth. And no wonder\\r\\nthat she had been attracted by Arthur Phillips, with his big, black,\\r\\nmelancholy eyes, and his fine intellectual face. One good nature\\r\\nspeedily detects its counterpart in another, and it was a testimonial\\r\\nof high and noble character to be loved by a woman like Phœbe.\\r\\nLove perpetrates strange, mad freaks, but it would have been next to\\r\\nimpossible for a pure nature like Phœbe’s to have allied itself\\r\\nwith another that was unworthy.Luke Somerton and his wife grew quite genial in the presence of the\\r\\nradiating love-beams that seemed to shine about the lovers; and the\\r\\nbailiff thought about his young days in the great Lincolnshire fens and\\r\\nwolds. He and his elder brother had quarrelled when they were boys,\\r\\nabout Sarah Howard, his present wife. Luke had loved her passionately,\\r\\nand had been persistent in his attentions towards her; but Sarah\\r\\nplayed her cards to win the elder brother, who[Pg 201] would come in for the great bulk of the\\r\\nproperty. She was worldly, as you have seen, and had fixed upon doing\\r\\ngreat things if she married the elder Somerton. But it was only Luke\\r\\nwho really loved her; his brother flirted with her, and eventually\\r\\nmarried a rich widow, whereupon Sarah Howard was fain to be content\\r\\nwith Luke, who had quarrelled with his brother, not because his\\r\\nbrother loved Sarah, but because he did not. For Luke, like a great,\\r\\nfond Lincolnshire lad as he was, on learning that Miss Howard liked\\r\\nhis elder brother better than himself, had actually given her up, and\\r\\ncalled upon his brother to marry her. And now Luke looked back to\\r\\nthese days, and remembered the time when Sarah had professed to return\\r\\nhis love, and when they walked to the church through the meadows,\\r\\nand over the bridge that spanned the sparkling beck; and he heard\\r\\nthe half-a-dozen bells ringing afterwards,—heard them now after all\\r\\nthose years: and he was happier in these memories because he knew that\\r\\nthese two lovers really loved each other, both[Pg 202] of them as truly as he had loved Sarah\\r\\nHoward.Mrs. Somerton would now and then become quite cheerful, and tell\\r\\nArthur in fun how she had disliked him once, because she could see he\\r\\nwas after Amy; and this would start conversations and confessions that\\r\\ngave the greatest pleasure to all concerned.Arthur would bring Phœbe bundles of newspapers and magazines\\r\\nin which his pictures were criticised. And Phœbe would blush\\r\\nwith delight over the praises there bestowed upon her lover, and look\\r\\ndreadfully astonished when any critic threw in some adverse suggestion\\r\\nor observation. The Pyrotechnic said Arthur Phillips was at the\\r\\nhead of his profession; no previous artist had combined landscape and\\r\\nfigure painting with the success which had crowned his efforts: he was\\r\\nSalvator Rosa and Wilkie in one. Happily the higher class journals\\r\\nand the art magazines were more judicious in their commendations\\r\\nthan this, but they all agreed that Mr. Phillips had a genius[Pg 203] for painting, and knew\\r\\nhow to put that genius into his pictures; so the artist was not only on\\r\\nthe high-road to lasting fame, but to monetary competence. He therefore\\r\\ntalked to Phœbe of their future with confidence, and Mrs.\\r\\nSomerton was not a little pleased to learn that after all her daughter\\r\\nwould be the wife of a thriving man.There was something prophetic, Arthur thought, in his title of\\r\\nthat picture which had given the finishing touch to his professional\\r\\nreputation; and Phœbe pressed his arm as he said so whilst\\r\\nthey were walking up to the summer-house on those dear Berne Hills.\\r\\nSomething quite prophetic! That gleam of inspiration which had fallen\\r\\nupon him in connection with those poor emigrants could only have been a\\r\\nstroke of Destiny: the tide was at the flood, and Fate pointed in the\\r\\nright direction. “Seeking New Homes!” It was the key-note to all the\\r\\nrecent events in their history. They were all on the eve of seeking\\r\\nnew homes: Mr. Somerton, Mrs. Somerton, Paul Somerton, Miss Tallant,\\r\\nand Phœbe, and himself.[Pg\\r\\n204] New homes! What a pleasant, happy ring there was in the\\r\\nwords! Arthur drew all sorts of imaginary word-pictures of their home\\r\\nin the future; and it was a paradise indeed, with such a studio, where\\r\\nPhœbe should have an easel, too,—such a home, the home of Love\\r\\nand Art!If Arthur grew enthusiastically poetic in the contemplation of this\\r\\nfuture, who could feel surprised? Walking abroad with Phœbe\\r\\nSomerton hanging on his arm, betrothed to him, almost mated like the\\r\\nbirds that were building their nests all round about them. Was it not a\\r\\npoetic time? Is there any period of the year more eloquent to lovers,\\r\\nmore fairy-like, more hopeful than Spring?And Spring in that Berne Hill country! Alike in every other season\\r\\nyou saw all the special beauties of the time in the neighbourhood of\\r\\nBarton Hall. Standing near the summer-house (where Richard Tallant\\r\\nplayed the eaves-dropper to that naïve conversation, of which he\\r\\nreminded his sister so recently), Arthur and Phœbe may well[Pg 205] feel that their lines\\r\\nhave been cast in pleasant places; that Heaven is dealing tenderly\\r\\nwith them; that the future will be a blessed time like this. The sky\\r\\nabove them is full of blue and white,—great silver mountains piled upon\\r\\neach other in an azure sea. A lark is mounting upwards, with a cheery\\r\\nsong that is answered by a thousand wood-notes in the grove beneath.\\r\\nFar away on every side stretch the green fields dotted with homesteads\\r\\nand villages, past which winds the river sparkling in the sun. Old\\r\\nchurch towers and steeples peep over the tree-tops in quiet glades,\\r\\nand white wreaths of smoke in the distance mark the course of railway\\r\\ntrains hurrying on their way to London. A misty cloud, half-penetrated\\r\\nby the sun, hangs over the Linktown Hills, and envelopes the sharp\\r\\noutlines that come out here and there in undulating curves, picturesque\\r\\nindications of their graceful lines of beauty. How eloquently\\r\\nArthur dwelt upon the glories of this great picture of Nature’s own\\r\\npainting!The trees were clothed with delicate verdant[Pg 206] tints, through which the graceful shapes\\r\\nof the budding branches were seen, and the white birch did indeed\\r\\nstand out like the fair lady of the woods, nodding her pretty head\\r\\nand shaking her tresses to the music of the birds. Phœbe hushed\\r\\nArthur’s voice at the piping of a nightingale in a copse hard by, and\\r\\nthe artist recalled old Izaak Walton’s exclamation, “Lord, what music\\r\\nhast Thou provided for the saints in heaven, when Thou affordest bad\\r\\nmen such music on earth!”Whether it was the associations of the place with former times or\\r\\nthe words “bad men” that set Phœbe thinking of the time when\\r\\nthe wickedness of Richard Tallant was first strongly put before her,\\r\\nlisteth not; but she began to talk of Amy and of Lionel Hammerton.“He said something about Paul—her brother in those days, you know,\\r\\nwhen you were Miss Tallant—something about prying into his affairs.”“Paul had followed him to the club, and warned him against some\\r\\npersons who were conspiring to win his money at cards.”“Oh yes, I remember something of it; but I was not aware that the\\r\\nsurveillance had gone so far. Mr. Hammerton was being deceived, I\\r\\nthink, Amy said. There was a plot against him, she thought; but, poor\\r\\ngirl, she was so deeply in love with him.”“He felt annoyed that she had interfered in his private doings,”\\r\\nsaid Arthur; “he thought it was officious, I suppose.”Arthur had too much regard for his old friend even now to hint that\\r\\nLionel thought Amy was influenced by mere worldly motives.“Not as I love you,” said Arthur; “but our love, dearest, is a love\\r\\napart from any other love; it seems to me that nobody in the whole\\r\\nworld is blessed like I am with a love so generous, so noble. What have\\r\\nI done that I should deserve so much happiness?”“Dear Arthur!” was all Phœbe could say, and then for a time\\r\\nthey forgot all the world but themselves and the trees and flowers\\r\\nand grasses and the distant hills and the spring sky above them, with\\r\\nthe hopeful lark in the sunshine, and the nightingale singing in the\\r\\nshade.What a delightful path it was, that old familiar way by which\\r\\nthey returned to the farm! Wood-sorrel, buttercups, sweet woodroof,\\r\\nprimroses, and[Pg 209]\\r\\nviolets bespangled and scented the way; green grasses and ferns shot\\r\\nout like emerald spikes and crooks from amongst dead leaves that autumn\\r\\nwinds had left in out-of-the-way corners. The lake in the shadow of the\\r\\nhills shone here and there through the trees like glints of silver, and\\r\\nthe sunbeams sparkled white and shimmery on the windows of Barton Hall.\\r\\nAt length the lovers stopped beside a rustic stile near the foot of the\\r\\nhills—one of those old-fashioned, moss-grown, lichen-coloured stiles,\\r\\nwhich give such additional charms to straggling hedge-rows, with great\\r\\nclumps of flowering hawthorn here and there at the top, and patches\\r\\nof red and brown and amber in the old roots at the bottom. Beneath a\\r\\nbending branch of budding May-flowers Arthur pointed out the spot where\\r\\nhe had sat for hours to paint and think of her in the summer-time, and\\r\\nshe saw that the place commanded a full view of the room where she\\r\\nmostly sat.Oh, what a happy time it was! The spring[Pg 210] wind went about the woods in gentle\\r\\nmurmurs, as if it were saying so in every nook and corner. “How are\\r\\nyou, old friend?” it seemed to say every now and then, as it rustled\\r\\nthe young leaves of an oak or an elm—“glad to see you looking so\\r\\nwell—pleasant day;” and the trees seemed to nod and look happy, and\\r\\ncongratulate each other that the south wind had come again, and the ash\\r\\ntrees shook their jangling locks with delight. Everything seemed to say\\r\\nthe winter is over, and we are glad of it and sure of it. The frogs\\r\\ncroaked by the margin of the lake, and the crows replied as they winged\\r\\ntheir way over them up into the elms that glassed themselves in the\\r\\ndeep. Bees hummed musically in the air, and darted into the midst of\\r\\ngreat yellow buttercups as if in very wantonness of joy. What a happy\\r\\ntime it was! Everything seemed to say so—birds and trees and hills and\\r\\nfields. There was a general jubilation of Nature, such as the Psalmist\\r\\nmight have had in his mind when he sang, “Let the floods clap their\\r\\nhands, and let[Pg 211] the\\r\\nhills be joyful together before the Lord.”Happy days! Why do we dwell upon them? It is not easy to close any\\r\\npage which has spring sunshine in it. We have all of us so many dear,\\r\\ntreasured associations with it, bringing us back to the spring-time\\r\\nof life when the world looked so hopeful and charming—when there were\\r\\nflowers of love and friendship in our paths, and we knew nothing of the\\r\\nthorns that lurked beneath them.The spring did not bring happy days with it in the city of London.\\r\\nThe south wind had no influence on that financial storm which had\\r\\nnot yet subsided. It brought no comfort to unhappy speculators and\\r\\ntottering houses of trade. The city sparrows shambled from under the\\r\\neaves, and rolled themselves in the dust of the great city, and street\\r\\nboys whistled merrily along the hard pavements; but great merchants\\r\\nheld down their heads, directors of companies hurried to and fro with\\r\\ngreat secrets in their hearts that troubled them sorely; countrymen\\r\\nstared vacantly up at offices and banks that were closed and marked “To\\r\\nLet.” The genius of finance, and not spring, had full possession of the\\r\\nCity, and he was[Pg 213]\\r\\ntormenting it with panic fiends and imps of all kinds.People had said six months previously that the worst was over;\\r\\nbut the genius of finance looked on with a sardonic grin, and after\\r\\nbreathing awhile quietly he set to work again, shaking the city with\\r\\nall his might, and letting flights of rumours out of his black bag that\\r\\nfrightened people almost out of their wits. Then the telegraph wires\\r\\ncarried the rumours far away into the country once more, and newspaper\\r\\neditors began to write furiously about the currency; deputations waited\\r\\non the Chancellor of the Exchequer to talk about the Bank Charter Act;\\r\\nand the court of the Bank of England sat in secret, and raised the rate\\r\\nof discount. The more that big demon of finance shook the City, the\\r\\nhigher went up the Bank barometer, and the higher it rose the lower\\r\\nfell the hopes of traders, and discounters, and shaky companies.The period of panic through which the monetary world is passing\\r\\nwhilst we are writing this[Pg\\r\\n214] history, has nearly all the characteristics of the one\\r\\nwhich occurred in the days of Thomas Dibble and Richard Tallant, and\\r\\nthe other persons who make up this poor drama of life. Every ten years\\r\\nthese storms occur, they say; and yet the wise people who say so, never\\r\\nseem prepared for the rainy day.Mr. Richard Tallant had hitherto succeeded in profiting by the\\r\\nstorm. He was one of those financial wreckers who plundered the broken\\r\\nships, and made money out of claims for salvage after the crews were\\r\\nmurdered. But he had believed, like some others, that the worst was\\r\\npast during that breathing time, and in an evil hour for him he had,\\r\\non good information, bought largely of shares in the Bungalay Bank,\\r\\nand had taken a seat at the board of directors. The thing collapsed\\r\\nimmediately on the revival of the financial storm, and Mr. Tallant’s\\r\\nlosses were so considerable, that the four thousand pounds which he\\r\\nhad screwed out of Twyzell and Kits were absolutely necessary to meet\\r\\nand float fresh[Pg 215]\\r\\nbills of exchange which had been useful bladders to him in the monetary\\r\\nsea for some time past. Several “good things” had come to the ground\\r\\nwithout warning, including a discount house in which Mr. Tallant was\\r\\ninterested.The times were peculiarly ticklish for many a stronger man than\\r\\nRichard Tallant; but that gentleman found himself in a position which\\r\\nneeded all his administrative ability. He not only held a large number\\r\\nof shares in the Bungalay Bank, but he had used the establishment\\r\\nlargely in connection with the Discount Company for bill purposes.\\r\\nHe had worked his position at the Meter Iron Works to considerable\\r\\nadvantage, drawing upon foreign iron houses, and other companies\\r\\n(some of them quite imaginary), and holding their acceptances to a\\r\\nlarge amount. The collapse of the Bungalay Bank and the Discount\\r\\nCompany made things particularly unpleasant. It would not do for him\\r\\nto sell to any extent the shares he held in the Meter Works; for his\\r\\nholding there gave him a strong position at the[Pg 216] board. He had before now made money out\\r\\nof winding up a bank; but there had been no opportunity for this in\\r\\nthe Bungalay, and Mr. Tallant had a shrewd suspicion that he had been\\r\\n“done” in this business, seeing that the promoter of the bank was the\\r\\ngentleman who had brought it to the ground by a petition to wind it\\r\\nup.Keeping up appearances was a thing of great importance to Mr.\\r\\nTallant—next indeed to meeting his engagements. He therefore took an\\r\\nopportunity to let it be known in the proper quarter that his sister\\r\\nwas going to be married to Earl Verner, which fact speedily came forth\\r\\nin the Morning Post, and was copied by a host of other journals.\\r\\n“The Right Hon. the Earl Verner will shortly lead to the hymeneal\\r\\naltar, Miss Tallant, daughter and heiress of the late Christopher\\r\\nTallant, Esq., of Barton Hall, and sister to Richard Tallant, Esq., of\\r\\nthe City of London, Managing Director of the famous Meter Iron Works\\r\\nCompany.”Lord Verner did not much like this announcement.[Pg 217] The thing might have\\r\\nbeen blazoned forth in all the papers so far as the mere fact was\\r\\nconcerned; but he objected to the introduction of Richard Tallant into\\r\\nthe announcement. He was her brother, no doubt, but he was a scoundrel\\r\\nhe believed in addition, and his father had disowned him.His lordship showed Amy the Post, and she only laughed at it,\\r\\nand said how very absurd to mention her brother.“Though by the way, my lord, he is wonderfully improved, I believe.\\r\\nHe is making quite a reputation in that dreadful London.”“Is he, my love?” said Lord Verner, looking down at Miss Tallant, as\\r\\nshe put the last touches to a water-colour drawing.“Yes, I have seen his name in the papers several times lately\\r\\nmentioned almost as respectfully as his late father’s.”What a splendid creature she is, Lord Verner thought, as he stood by\\r\\nher side, forgetting altogether about her brother. “Is not that[Pg 218] sky slightly too blue?”\\r\\nhe said, leaning over her.“Perhaps it is my love—my lord, I mean,” said Amy, at which his\\r\\nlordship was in raptures; so much so, that he put his arm round the\\r\\npainter’s waist, and kissed her.“There!” said Amy, laughing. “I will call you love no more—what a\\r\\nmistake I made to be sure; now, pray go away, you will spoil my work.\\r\\nSit down, and let us talk.”“I ought not to be wasting time upon this,” said Amy; “but I really\\r\\ncould not resist finishing it this morning. Let me see, what were we\\r\\ntalking about. Oh, my brother. Well, as I observed, he is really making\\r\\nquite a position as a financier—quite. What a pity it is, he did not\\r\\nbegin to reform before Mr. Tallant died.”“That is a matter of opinion, my dear—ha, ha, ha!” said Lord\\r\\nVerner, laughing and chuckling[Pg\\r\\n219] quite merrily; “he would have had all the money then,\\r\\nperhaps—ha, ha!”Amy turned round and looked his lordship full in the face, and saw\\r\\nat once that this was said in jest.“Don’t you see, my love, you would have had no great fortune to\\r\\ngive your husband—eh? don’t you see! How it might have influenced\\r\\nevents—eh? Ha, ha!”Lord Verner went red in the face at the bare idea of anything\\r\\ninfluencing his choice of Amy for a wife.“No, now, you do not,” said his lordship, rising and taking her hand\\r\\nquite gravely; “I am sure you do not.”Now it was Amy’s turn to laugh, and she did so right merrily,\\r\\nshaking her finger archly at her lord and saying, “There, that is one\\r\\nto me, as you say. Of course I was joking; but now, really, let us talk\\r\\nseriously.”“Well, then, my dearest girl,” said his lordship, “if you had been\\r\\nno more than that bailiff’s daughter, if you had been that beggar maid\\r\\nyou talk of in the poem, I would have asked you to marry me all the\\r\\nsame, and felt blessed with your consent. You know I would,” said his\\r\\nlordship, with passionate earnestness.“What care I for money,” said his lordship, “except for the luxuries\\r\\nit can purchase?—and nothing it could purchase would make me so happy\\r\\nas I am with you.”Amy held down her head and blushed, not for[Pg 221] the love she bore him, but because in\\r\\nthat earnest moment she saw a likeness to his brother, and she was\\r\\ngrateful for his affection, and remembered how she had sought to\\r\\ninspire the same feeling in another.“We were talking of my brother,” she said presently, laying down\\r\\nher brushes. “What a pity it is that we are not friendly; it seems so\\r\\nlonely to think that I have no male relative who should stand by my\\r\\nside at our marriage.”Poor Amy! There was something in that half-threat of Richard\\r\\nTallant’s about giving her away which had set her thinking and\\r\\npreparing for such a contingency as a demand from her brother to be\\r\\na wedding guest; and she knew that if he vowed to be there at the\\r\\nceremony, there was no Ancient Mariner to take him by the button, and\\r\\nkeep him away. She almost hated herself for saying a word in favour\\r\\nof one whose conduct ought to have placed him outside all decent\\r\\nsociety.“Don’t think of that, my dear girl,” said his lordship. “Lord Tufton\\r\\nwill ‘give you away,’ as[Pg\\r\\n222] the service hath it, and I will be by your side.”“You are so kind and considerate,” said Amy. “You do not like me\\r\\nto thank you, and I will not; but supposing I had a brother worthy\\r\\nof being present, how nice it would have been: it will seem so very\\r\\nstrange to have no one belonging to me at such a time. If Lieutenant\\r\\nSomerton had really been my brother.”Miss Tallant was pleased at this kindly recognition of her\\r\\nsometime brother Paul, and from that time she desisted further in her\\r\\npreliminary suggestions with regard to her real brother.Meanwhile the arrangements for the wedding went on, and hardly a day\\r\\nwent by which did not bring some handsome present from Lord Verner.\\r\\nHis lordship had been over to Paris specially to make a purchase of\\r\\nsome famous court diamonds, which he had learnt were in the market.\\r\\nThere[Pg 223] was nothing\\r\\ntoo good nor too costly for this charming woman at Barton Hall.It was almost like buying the young lady to load her so with\\r\\npresents and compliments, and already all the people at Montem Castle\\r\\nwere profoundly jealous of her. The housekeeper, the valet, the cook,\\r\\nthe chaplain, even the vicar at Brazencrook, close by, were jealous\\r\\nof the coming queen. The Castle had been undergoing all sorts of\\r\\nalterations during the last few months. Painters and decorators, and\\r\\nupholsterers, and cabinet-makers, had swarmed in every part of it,\\r\\nand his lordship had looked into every nook and corner of the place\\r\\nhimself. The gardeners had been compelled to seek assistance, and\\r\\nstrange men from London, calling themselves florists, had been down,\\r\\nand planted all manner of strange-looking plants and shrubs. The whole\\r\\nplace had been in a state of commotion, and his lordship had never been\\r\\nknown to be so active, nor so well. When the vicar ventured, on the\\r\\nstrength of old familiarity, to rally his lordship upon his improved\\r\\nhealth and[Pg 224] spirits,\\r\\nthe Earl laughed and chuckled, and said he had no time to be ill; he\\r\\ndid not intend to be ill any more; he had wasted enough valuable time\\r\\nupon that hobby.Then the vicar would go home to chat with Mrs. Vicar about the\\r\\nchanges which were taking place, and wonder what Mr. Hammerton thought\\r\\nabout the affair. Of course he knew nothing of it at present; there had\\r\\nscarcely been time for letters to reach him since the match had really\\r\\nbeen settled and made known.Everybody in the neighbourhood of Montem Castle and at Brazencrook\\r\\nhad looked upon the Hon. Lionel Hammerton as certain of the earldom.\\r\\nNot only was his brother considerably his senior—old enough to be his\\r\\nfather—but he had generally been an invalid, and looked much older than\\r\\nhe really was. But his lordship was far stronger than they imagined.\\r\\nHe had loved retirement and study, and frequently secured it by a\\r\\npretence of not being well. He had a horror of “boredom”; he could not\\r\\nendure toadyism; he[Pg 225]\\r\\nloved his books and his pictures, his old china, his statuary; and\\r\\nhe preferred this to the best society in the district, though he and\\r\\nthe vicar and occasional visitors dined luxuriously together, and sat\\r\\ngenially over their wine until late in the night.It was generally agreed that his lordship was odd, and nobody\\r\\ndoubted that some day he would be found dead in his bed, and that\\r\\nLionel Hammerton would succeed and make up for the former Earl’s\\r\\nretirement by a liberal reign and a generous performance of the duties\\r\\nof his high station. But his lordship had opened their eyes of late,\\r\\nand turned the gossip into entirely new and unexpected channels.Earl Verner’s intended wife had not misinterpreted Richard\\r\\nTallant’s vague threat. The idea had only occurred to him suddenly\\r\\nas an available bit of sarcasm to hurl at his sister; but he had\\r\\nthought of it in the railway, lighted his cigar with it at the\\r\\njunction, and it had cropped up in his thoughts several times since.\\r\\nTo be publicly[Pg 226]\\r\\nreconciled to his sister, and be seen hand and glove with Lord Verner;\\r\\nto be recorded as giving away his sister to an Earl, would be of\\r\\ngreat advantage to him, just at that time when it was important he\\r\\nshould keep up appearances. So he resolved to write to his sister upon\\r\\nthe subject, and Amy was not at all surprised when she received the\\r\\nletter.Nevertheless, Amy’s first impulse was to explain the whole thing\\r\\nto Lord Verner, and entreat his advice and forgiveness; but her\\r\\nsecond thoughts were calmer and more worldly, and she wrote a brief\\r\\nacknowledgment of Mr. Tallant’s letter, drove to Avonworth, and\\r\\nposted it herself, that the servants might not know there was any\\r\\ncorrespondence between her brother and herself. She promised to give\\r\\nthe subject her best consideration, and on the next opportunity\\r\\nthat offered she again introduced the question to Earl Verner. That\\r\\nshe might do so more easily, and with a better chance of success,\\r\\nMr. Richard Tallant had forwarded a copy of the Severntown[Pg 227] Times, in which the\\r\\nfollowing paragraph was marked:“I had thought of my brother Lionel for[Pg 228] Severntown,” said Lord Verner, when\\r\\nAmy showed his lordship the paragraph; “but I have given that up, of\\r\\ncourse,—he was too extravagant.”Miss Tallant made no remark about Lionel; but endeavoured to impress\\r\\nhis lordship with the growing importance of her brother, and what a\\r\\nposition he might have held had he made his peace with his father\\r\\nbefore he died; then by degrees she presented herself in the light of\\r\\nan ungrateful sister, and talked about the duty of forgiveness.Need we say that in the end she gained her point, which was not\\r\\nexactly permission to invite her brother to be present at the ceremony,\\r\\nbut that Earl Verner should himself suggest that perhaps it would be\\r\\nbest that Mr. Richard Tallant should be asked to act the paternal part\\r\\non the interesting occasion. He had called upon her, Amy explained, and\\r\\nthis newspaper was directed to her by himself. He had made overtures of\\r\\npeace; was it not her place as the inheritor of so much property, which\\r\\nought to have[Pg 229] been\\r\\nhis, to respond, and thus give him an additional inducement to blot out\\r\\nthe past, and make reparation to society and to his father’s memory?\\r\\nOf course it was. Lord Verner was too liberal a man not to see this at\\r\\nonce, and not to love his intended wife all the more for her generous\\r\\nand noble advocacy of her brother.The regiment to which Ensign afterwards Lieutenant Somerton was\\r\\nattached had its station in London, and this gave him an opportunity of\\r\\nkeeping up his friendship with Mr. Williamson.The Lieutenant had become quite a dashing young officer, and his\\r\\nadventures began early, as we shall learn from an elaborate confession\\r\\nwhich he made to Mr. Williamson before he had worn his epaulettes six\\r\\nmonths.They were sitting at the window of a famous hotel at Brighton,\\r\\nwhither they had gone together for a day’s lounge. It was a pleasant\\r\\nsummer[Pg 231] day, and\\r\\nafter dinner, when Paul, smoking a cigar somewhat rapidly and drinking\\r\\na little more wine than was customary for him to drink, said:“Yes,” said Mr. Williamson, in his lazy fashion putting up his legs\\r\\nupon a vacant chair, and nodding a smiling signal of approval.Paul hesitated, and said it was rather a long story, and he\\r\\nfidgetted with a tassel that hung from the sword he had laid upon the\\r\\nwindow seat.Paul gave a long pull and a strong pull at his cigar, and said he\\r\\nwould proceed. “I must tell you,—I can’t rest unless I do,—so here\\r\\ngoes.”“Open confession is good for the soul,” said Mr. Williamson; “the\\r\\nauricular business is not to my fancy. But there, go on, Lieutenant, I\\r\\nam getting interested.”“About a month ago Captain Macshawser gave me a tip about a certain\\r\\nsteeple-chase, and his information turned out wrong, and——”“You laid a wager and lost, yes,” said Mr. Williamson, looking out\\r\\nto the sea, and smoking with perfect content.“And then, in order to get back what I lost, I ventured to take the\\r\\nodds about Fleetwing, and was unsuccessful again,” said Paul, with\\r\\nboyish frankness.“Very good; I am glad of it,” said Mr. Williamson. “I hope you have\\r\\nbeen so well punished that you will, like the burnt child, dread the\\r\\nfire in the future.”Paul did not like the quiet tone of authority and rebuke in which his\\r\\nfriend appeared to speak; but he felt that the barrister was in the\\r\\nright, and had his interest at heart.“You don’t sympathise with me much?” said Paul, moving uneasily in\\r\\nhis seat, and smoking by fits and starts.“O yes, I do, Lieutenant—O yes, I do; I[Pg 233] fancy that Macshawser’s a humbug; but I\\r\\ninterrupt your narrative.”“Well; these losses, and some extra expenditure which I felt called\\r\\nupon to make in a little dinner to some fellows belonging to the\\r\\nGuards, run away with my allowance twice over before I knew where I\\r\\nwas.”“You have been going it, as the saying is,—been fast in the double\\r\\nsense. We say a man is fast who is fond of gaiety, keeps late hours,\\r\\nbets on horse races, and takes ‘tips.’ In Yorkshire, a man who is ‘hard\\r\\nup’ is said to be fast,—fast for money. Are you fast for money now? If\\r\\nso, how much do you want?” said Mr. Williamson still, looking before\\r\\nhim far away at the ships in the distance.“You had better let me tell you the whole story through,” Paul\\r\\nreplied. “I was ashamed to let anybody know that I wanted money; I\\r\\ncould not summon courage even to tell you, and should not have had\\r\\ncourage to do so even now but for another circumstance which has arisen\\r\\nout of it.”“I thought of a hundred ways of raising money, and I knew that some\\r\\nof our fellows borrow money of Jews; I did not know what to do. Whilst\\r\\nI was sitting over the Times and a cigar in my own quarters, my\\r\\neye caught an advertisement about ‘money to lend.’”Mr. Wilkinson grew particularly interested at this point, for a\\r\\ndetective friend of his had told him some time ago that he had been on\\r\\nthe trail of Shuffleton Gibbs, who had slipped him, in the character,\\r\\nhe believed, of an advertising money-lender.“I replied to the advertisement, and had a letter by return of post\\r\\nrequesting me to call at No. 15, Chaucer-street, Lincoln’s-inn-fields.\\r\\nI called, and was requested to fill up a long form, in which I answered\\r\\na great many questions; but I concealed my connection with the army.\\r\\nMy life was to be insured, and a bill of exchange, backed by one good\\r\\nname besides my own, for two hundred and fifty pounds would secure to\\r\\nme[Pg 235] two hundred for\\r\\nthree months. I paid the two guineas and a fee the next day for medical\\r\\nexamination. Two days afterwards they informed me that the medical\\r\\nofficer of the company had made an unfavourable report with regard\\r\\nto the state of my health, and that the loan could not therefore be\\r\\ngranted.”“I asked for the return of the fees which I had paid, and was\\r\\ninformed that no fees were ever returned. I felt that I had been\\r\\nswindled, but still could not rest until I had undergone an examination\\r\\nby our own surgeon, and been reported sound in wind and limb.”“Well,” said Mr. Wilkinson, “you have been making experience; your\\r\\nstory grows in interest; make a clean breast of it, perhaps I can help\\r\\nyou.”“I did not know what to do next; somehow these advertisements\\r\\nattracted my attention again. I found one which really did seem\\r\\nhonest.[Pg 236] It stated\\r\\nthat gentlemen in the army and others requiring temporary loans might\\r\\nobtain them with strict privacy on application to Mr. Jefferson\\r\\nCrawley, at Titchwell-street West. I wrote to Mr. Crawley, determined\\r\\nnot to be done a second time. I was desired to call, and with some\\r\\ndifficulty I found the place—rather a queer place, too; through a mews,\\r\\nand in a back, out-of-the-way corner I found a shabby-looking office,\\r\\nand entered. A small boy sat at a small desk and said his master was\\r\\nout, and whilst he was saying so a girl came into the office by a\\r\\nflight of stairs at the back.”Paul threw the stump end of a cigar out of window, and coughed\\r\\nto conceal some little confusion which this part of the narrative\\r\\noccasioned him.“The first part of the confession has a good sound—confession and\\r\\nthen repentance; but ‘can’t help it’ is a horse of another colour. Out\\r\\nwith the whole story, my friend; you will find me mum as a priest, and\\r\\nI’ll give you absolution, too.”“She said she must apologize for Mr. Crawley; he had been quite\\r\\nunexpectedly called away and would not return until evening; but she\\r\\nwas acquainted with my business, and would I kindly step inside for a\\r\\nmoment. I followed her into a small room, a miserable sort of attempt\\r\\nat a parlour, wretchedly furnished. I took a seat and almost forgot my\\r\\nbusiness—I was so taken up with the woman. She was to ask if I knew\\r\\nCaptain Macshawser, and if that officer would join me in a bill. I\\r\\nfelt ashamed to talk about the subject to a woman, and especially such\\r\\na[Pg 238] pretty one, and I\\r\\nsaid as much, but in a different way.”“You let her see that you were admiring her, of course,” said Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson, adding, sotto voce, “innocent youth!”“How it was I don’t know, but we got into a long conversation, and\\r\\nit came out quite by accident that she knew Severntown, and she spoke\\r\\nabout the place so familiarly that I felt sure I had seen her before.\\r\\nI thought so at first, and was convinced of it when she mentioned the\\r\\nold cathedral city. I don’t know how long I stayed, but I said no more\\r\\nabout money, and I never felt so much pleasure in talking to a girl in\\r\\nall my life. I went away, promising to call again, and I secretly hoped\\r\\nthat Mr. Crawley would still be from home at my next visit.”“I did not inquire at that time,” said Paul; “I longed so to see her\\r\\nagain, that I called in the afternoon, and she was out; I was[Pg 239] very much disappointed.\\r\\nThe boy said she would be in soon, and I sat down and waited. I felt\\r\\nmiserable, I hardly knew why. I asked the scrubby-looking clerk if\\r\\nthe young lady were Mr. Crawley’s daughter? He said ‘No.’ Was she his\\r\\nsister? I asked. ‘No,’ he said again. Somehow, I felt as if I dare\\r\\nnot ask if she were his wife. Whilst I was thinking and wondering who\\r\\nshe could be—such a sweet charming girl in such a place (Paul went on\\r\\nexcitedly)—in she came. I jumped up and shook hands with her, and felt\\r\\nas if I had known her for years.”Here Paul rose from his seat and walked about the room. Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson had never seen him so agitated before. He had no idea\\r\\nthat there was so much fire and enthusiasm in the young fellow. The\\r\\nbarrister left the ships at sea, and watched his young friend with\\r\\na kindly interest which he had not exhibited hitherto during the\\r\\nconversation.“She asked me to come in,” said Paul, still[Pg 240] pacing the room. “We talked again of\\r\\nanything and everything but the business upon which I was supposed to\\r\\nhave called. I could see that she was troubled about something—how I\\r\\nhad courage enough to press her upon the subject I don’t know, but I\\r\\ndid, and she began to cry.”“Curse their tears!” said the barrister, between his teeth, as he\\r\\nremoved his legs from the vacant chair, and, planting them firmly on\\r\\nthe floor, gazed steadfastly at Paul.“I took her hand; I don’t know what I said, but I think it was that\\r\\nI loved her, and begged to know how I could be of service to her.\\r\\nShe looked up at me—with such despair that I could almost have cried\\r\\nmyself—and begged me not to talk of love; she was married!”“Good heavens!” exclaimed Mr. Williamson. The remark was wrung from\\r\\nhim, not so much by Paul’s story as by a touch of memory.“I knew she was—I felt almost from the first that she was married;\\r\\nit seemed as if some devil[Pg\\r\\n241] whispered it in my ear to mock me; but it only made me love\\r\\nher ten times more.”“Her husband treated her cruelly, she said; he was a swindler, a\\r\\nthief, everything that was bad, and he had married her merely that\\r\\nshe might assist him in his conspiracies. She would rather die than\\r\\ncontinue such a life, and I could not help but feel that the love she\\r\\nhad inspired in me was returned; she seemed almost delirious for a\\r\\ntime, asked me not to leave her, and clasped her hand to her head. At\\r\\nthis the office-boy came in, and taking some water from a jug, said,\\r\\n‘Put that on the top of her head,’ I obeyed him mechanically, and then\\r\\nthe girl was herself again. ‘Peter,’ she said to the boy, ‘you will not\\r\\nmention what has occurred to Mr. Crawley.’ ‘Of course I shan’t,’ said\\r\\nthe boy, and then she begged me to go. I made her promise to let me\\r\\nhelp her in some way, and she cautioned me not to have anything to do\\r\\nwith her husband. She said I might call the next[Pg 242] night at six. I kissed her and left the\\r\\nhouse, not knowing where I was or what I was doing.”“By Jove,” said Mr. Williamson, “it is an exciting story, and you\\r\\ntell it well, Paul; but I fear it is a sad affair: you are getting into\\r\\ntroubled waters. Rest awhile, light another cigar, let us have some\\r\\nmore sherry, and then you can go on; I think I know the end of it—poor\\r\\nfellow!”The barrister put his hand quite affectionately on the Lieutenant’s\\r\\nshoulder, and then rang the bell, saying all the time, “Poor\\r\\nfellow!—poor fellow!”They lighted fresh cigars as the sun went down in the West, and\\r\\nArundel Williamson felt the spirit of old days come over him.A sad train of thoughts and memories had been awakened in the\\r\\nbarrister’s mind; and he placed his chair near his young friend, and\\r\\nbade him continue his story.“I passed a wretched night that night when I had left her, thinking\\r\\nof her troubles, and trying to remember where I had seen her; and my\\r\\nmind wandered away to Avonworth[Pg\\r\\n244] Valley, and it seemed as if I had known her when I was a\\r\\nchild. When I went to bed I dreamt that she was my sister, and that we\\r\\nlived at the farm; and then I was rescuing her from some blackguard who\\r\\nhad beaten her. I could not sleep, and I hardly know how the night and\\r\\nday passed. Macshawser came to me, and said he had had a mutual friend\\r\\nwith him making a private inquiry. He alluded to Mr. Jefferson Crawley,\\r\\nhe said; and wished I had mentioned the subject to him (the Captain)\\r\\nfirst. Of course he would have helped me at once; he could have put\\r\\nme in the way of getting the money apart from Crawley, though Crawley\\r\\nwas a decent sort of fellow. He said he would back my bill for me; of\\r\\ncourse my allowance was safe. I told him I would consider the matter\\r\\nfurther, and I resolved at once to write to my benefactress and ask for\\r\\na remittance on account: I felt that was the most honest way, after\\r\\nwhat she and Lord Verner had said to me.”“As six o’clock struck by a church clock somewhere in the thick of\\r\\nthe houses, I was at Crawley’s again. The office-boy was not there,\\r\\nMrs. Crawley was alone. I trembled like a schoolboy in her presence.\\r\\nShe seemed pleased to see me. Had I heard anything of her husband? she\\r\\nasked. I said ‘No;’ but I told her of the incident about Macshawser.\\r\\nShe said she need hardly ask if she might rely upon my honour and\\r\\nsecrecy. I assured her, and begged that she would show me how I could\\r\\nhelp her. It was not wrong to go thus far?”“She said Macshawser was an agent of the Jews; that although\\r\\nhe was an officer in the army, he was the secret spy and agent of\\r\\nmoney-lenders; that his business was to get into the confidence of\\r\\npeople, and particularly[Pg\\r\\n246] military men, and when they were in trouble for money\\r\\nhe made inquiries as to their position, then told them where to go,\\r\\nand afterwards got a bonus from the usurer to whom he had made his\\r\\nrecommendation.”“She told you the truth; my friend of Scotland Yard could tell you\\r\\nsome rare stories in illustration,” said the barrister.“Her husband,” she said, “was an agent of a lower stamp than this\\r\\ngentleman—of a much lower stamp; and what was worse, he did not confine\\r\\nhimself to this; but he cheated at cards, and expected her now and\\r\\nthen to assist in plucking young men whom they met by accident at a\\r\\nfriend’s in the West End, where Macshawser was an occasional visitor.\\r\\nHer husband had gone there now to dinner, and she was ordered to attend\\r\\nat eight o’clock. And then the tears rolled down her cheek, and I felt\\r\\nthat I could have laid my life down for her.”“Yes, yes—we are all alike,” said Mr. Williamson;[Pg 247] “those cursed tears, they\\r\\nmake fools of us all.”“Then she asked me if I did not truly pity her, and from that we\\r\\ngot to a mutual confession of love. She knew it was wicked, and she\\r\\nhad tried to fight against it, she said; but she loved me with all her\\r\\nheart, because I had had pity on her, and had loved her as a woman\\r\\nshould be loved before I had known she was married. We set to thinking\\r\\nwhat we should do under the circumstances, but all that I could think\\r\\nof was that she must get away from this fiend, her husband.”“Not at that time, but she has told me all her history since. I\\r\\nwent to see her the next evening at the same hour, and found her\\r\\npale and ill, and unlike herself. She had had a violent quarrel with\\r\\nher husband, who had subjected her to gross insult on the previous\\r\\nnight; she had refused to go out this evening, and I stayed with her\\r\\nuntil late, and tried to cheer her. We talked of Severntown,[Pg 248] and of her childhood. She\\r\\nnever remembered her mother; she had always understood that her mother\\r\\ndied when she was but a child. She dare not tell me, she said, how her\\r\\nyounger life had been spent, lest I should despise her; but she would\\r\\ntell me by-and-by. The more she said to prevent me from loving her, the\\r\\nmore my sympathies were excited, and I laid down a plan whereby she\\r\\nshould leave her husband the next day, if she would.”“I know it. I felt afterwards, in sober moments, that I had behaved\\r\\nmost foolishly, but I could not help it. The next morning twice the\\r\\nmoney I wanted reached me from Barton Hall, and this determined my\\r\\ncourse of action.”“I dare not; I seemed to be impelled by an infatuation that\\r\\novercame me completely. I went and hired a modest lodging for her\\r\\nout at Pimlico, not far from where the Dibbles lived; and that[Pg 249] evening at six I went\\r\\nagain, told her what I had done, and implored her to come with me.\\r\\nShe was paler and weaker than when I saw her the evening previously,\\r\\nand wandered a little in her talk. I told her she should not want—she\\r\\nshould be kindly treated—and talked of happiness in a distant land. I\\r\\nhardly know what I said. She came with me, and she has never rallied\\r\\nsince; she is very ill, and somehow I do not think she will live, and\\r\\nI love her so much, that if she should die, I think it would drive me\\r\\nmad.”And then the young fellow threw his arms upon the table, buried his\\r\\nface in his hands, and sobbed like a child.“Now, call me a fool, or what you like,” said Paul, in broken\\r\\naccents. “This is my trouble, and this my reason for going to town\\r\\nby the next train. I came with you to tell you my story; it has been\\r\\nbreaking my heart, and I know you are my best friend.”“Yes, yes,” said the barrister, taking Paul’s hand; “we are nearer\\r\\nand dearer friends than ever now, heaven help us! I will tell you of\\r\\nmy trouble some day, Paul. But about this poor woman: has she\\r\\nhad medical advice?”“Ha! that’s well. I think it is time we returned to town, then,”\\r\\nsaid the barrister. “Come, cheer up, Lieutenant; cheer up, man!”“I feel better now,” said Paul, taking up his sash, and slinging his\\r\\nsword round his waist. “A nice fellow to be a soldier, I am!” he went\\r\\non, as he wiped his face with his handkerchief.“You are a good fellow,” said the barrister; “unfortunate, but a\\r\\ngood fellow. What a blessing it is we know each other! I thank that\\r\\nrascal Gibbs that he put a certain young fellow to much trouble years\\r\\nago. I might never have known you but for that. It was necessary we\\r\\nshould know each other: the hand of Fate is in this business.”It was late when the two friends reached London. They drove from the\\r\\nstation to Pimlico, and halted at a house in a quiet bye-street. They\\r\\nboth entered, and dismissed the cab.“Poor creature! poor dear love!” said Mrs. Dibble; “she’th had a\\r\\nthad life for one so young though we all have our troublth. I’m thure\\r\\nif my pa could rithe and thee me, it would break hith heart, that it\\r\\nwould, to think that after having a boarding-thchool education, and\\r\\nbeing brought up[Pg 252]\\r\\nwith accomplishmenth at my fingerth ends, that I thould have to let my\\r\\nhuthband go out to thervice in hith old age, and live on the bounty of\\r\\nhim and Mithter Thomerton.”“In service? Why I thought Thomas had come back to live with\\r\\nyou, and that you were going on quite comfortably again?” said the\\r\\nbarrister.“Tho he did, tho he did,” said Mrs. Dibble, wiping her eyes; “but it\\r\\nwath only to bring fresh troublth. We were perthecuted by a showman—a\\r\\ndreadful, drunken perthon—and then we had to move, and what ith worth,\\r\\nthith panic, or whatever it ith, in the Thity, hath been our ruin; the\\r\\nbank in which our all wath depothited broke, and left uth without tho\\r\\nmuch ath five poundth in the world. If Mithter Thomerton had not helped\\r\\nuth—God bleth him for it!—we thould have been in the workhouth, and\\r\\none of the gentlemen at the bank who had known thomething of Dibble,\\r\\nhe[Pg 253] offered him a\\r\\nplace as his butler, and I came to live in thith little houthe, having\\r\\nthold motht of my other furniture: and loath I wath to part with that\\r\\npiano which poor pa bought me when I came home from boarding-thchool;\\r\\nand Dibble he hath a good place, and he comth home thometimeth, though\\r\\nwhat I thall do when the family goth for two month to Brazencrook,\\r\\nI don’t know; but the Lord have merthy on uth! My poor pa! my poor\\r\\npa!”The contemplation of what her poor pa would think of her forlorn\\r\\ncondition was too much for Mrs. Dibble, and she lapsed into silent\\r\\ntears, whilst Mr. Williamson bade her be of good cheer and asked her to\\r\\naccept a guinea for “auld lang syne.”Meanwhile the Lieutenant came down-stairs, looking more hopeful\\r\\nthan he had done previously. He certainly thought the poor girl was\\r\\nbetter.Paul shook hands with Mrs. Dibble, as he left the house, and then\\r\\nhe and his friend walked arm and arm out into the night, each occupied\\r\\nwith his own thoughts.O for the pen of that ready writer who is always in the humour for\\r\\nwork, who can always write, sir, who is never at a loss, who sits down\\r\\nbefore a ream of foolscap paper, and tosses off sheet after sheet, sir,\\r\\nuntil he is surrounded by piles of manuscript! I have seen him do it,\\r\\ncontinues the friend at our elbow—seen him do it. And then there’s Miss\\r\\n——, who is so awfully popular, you know, and stands to her work like\\r\\nan artist at his easel; she can write two novels a year like fun, and\\r\\nclever books too. George So-and-so, he goes down on his knees to write,\\r\\nand turns off slip after slip like a gusset and band coming out of a\\r\\nsewing machine. Mrs. —— plods away all day long, whether she likes it\\r\\nor not—pegs[Pg 256] away,\\r\\nsir, and produces a certain amount of copy before she dines; and she\\r\\ncan write two books at once, sir, like winking. That’s the woman for my\\r\\nmoney.O for the pen of one of these ready writers, that we might throw\\r\\noff in a few rapid pages the conclusion of all that romantic story\\r\\nwhich Paul Somerton told the barrister a few evenings after that day\\r\\nat Brighton. If we sat before that ream of foolscap, and filled every\\r\\nsheet, we could not do full justice to the extraordinary narrative,\\r\\nnor to the imagination of Mrs. Jefferson Crawley, the young lady whom\\r\\nyou met in the early part of our history as the showman’s daughter.\\r\\nYou remember how she gobbled up the tripe on that first evening, when\\r\\nMr. Dibble joined the company of the Temple of Magic to do the outside\\r\\nbusiness. You would hardly give her credit for imaginative power. She\\r\\nhandled the cards well, and was great in the basket trick, but you\\r\\nwould not expect her to possess what phrenologists call Ideality, in a\\r\\nlarge degree.Perhaps the education which she had received in a few months as the\\r\\nwife of our old acquaintance Mr. Gibbs, alias Jefferson Crawley,\\r\\nhad been beneficial to her in this respect. Mr. Crawley nevertheless\\r\\nhad been disappointed in the young woman. He did not find that her\\r\\nabilities as a shuffler at cards were of any great benefit to him; but\\r\\nshe was useful in some respects. There was an air of respectability\\r\\nthat was beneficial sometimes in speaking of “my wife,” and introducing\\r\\nMrs. Crawley, though the class of persons to whom introductions usually\\r\\ntook place cast knowing glances at each other, and commenced desperate\\r\\nflirtations with the young lady immediately. This was useful too,\\r\\nand Mr. Gibbs sometimes traded upon it in a way that was by no means\\r\\npleasant to the showman’s daughter. She was not a refined young woman\\r\\nas you have seen, not over-particular as you know; but she was vain of\\r\\nher good looks, and had just sufficient of woman’s amour propre,\\r\\nspeedily to contract a contempt for a husband who was base enough[Pg 258] and mean enough to be\\r\\nutterly indifferent to his wife’s honour.These two soon understood each other, almost indeed from the moment\\r\\nwhen Mr. Jefferson Crawley, having run away with the young woman,\\r\\nwished to set aside the ceremony of marriage which Christabel, the\\r\\nmysterious lady, had punctiliously insisted upon. What a wedding\\r\\nit was! What a honeymoon! Yet not stranger than ten thousand other\\r\\nweddings and honeymoons. Truth stranger than fiction! If that strange\\r\\nlittle fellow on two sticks who appeared so mysteriously to Don\\r\\nCleofas, would come and take you for an evening’s ramble, you would\\r\\nsee in half an hour how far fiction falls short of the realities of\\r\\nlife; how far the darkest pictures which those ready writers have\\r\\nlimned in pen and ink are less appalling than the realities of sin,\\r\\nand wickedness, and woe, which exist in the dark places of our modern\\r\\nBabylon! Ask that detective officer who used to visit the late Mr.\\r\\nChristopher Tallant at Barton Hall; he could[Pg 259] tell you some rare tales of the class of\\r\\npeople to whom Mr. and Mrs. Crawley belong. But even that gentleman\\r\\nwould be surprised if Asmodeus sat him down upon St. Paul’s, and\\r\\nunroofed a few hundred yards of that mass of brick, behind which the\\r\\ngreat game of life is being played out in ten thousand different\\r\\nways.Before Mr. Gibbs had been married three months, he gave his wife\\r\\npermission to find a better home if she could. He vowed he had no\\r\\ndesire to limit anybody’s freedom. As far as the work of the household\\r\\nwent, he said, looking round the miserable den, he thought he should\\r\\nlose nothing by the departure of the lady of the house. He could easily\\r\\nget somebody else to come and clean his boots, and cut bread and butter\\r\\nfor him. If the young lady thought it would advance her prospects to\\r\\nleave his humble roof, she might go; he should put no advertisement\\r\\nin the papers for her, he should employ no private detective to hunt\\r\\nher up: he was exceedingly obliged to her for becoming his wife,[Pg 260] highly honoured in fact,\\r\\nif not more so, but he should not break his heart if she returned to\\r\\nthe sawdust and naphtha lamps of the Temple of Magic.And so the young lady disappeared accordingly; but that wonderful\\r\\naccount which she gave of her early life, and which Lieutenant Somerton\\r\\nrepeated to the barrister, left out altogether those incidents to which\\r\\nher husband had alluded. She certainly did justice to the gambler’s\\r\\ntuition. Old Martin could never have taught her to be such a clever\\r\\ndissembler; and that melancholy clown who had on his deathbed presented\\r\\nher father with Momus, had certainly not wit enough to instruct her in\\r\\nsuch delicate cunning.The daughter of respectable parents at Severntown, her father\\r\\ndied early, and left her with a widowed mother. She had received but\\r\\nlittle education in consequence, and was obliged to go out to service.\\r\\nHer mother soon afterwards died, and then she was left alone in the\\r\\nwide,[Pg 261] wide world.\\r\\nShe had lived for some time with her aunt, who was then a wealthy lady,\\r\\nresiding at Carter Street West, but had since lost all her money in\\r\\nthe panic, and had gone to Paris. Her aunt was too poor to take her\\r\\nalong with her, or she would have done so; but she recommended her to\\r\\na lady in whose service she had endeavoured to study, and carry out\\r\\nthe good advice which her dear aunt had given her. The lady had a son\\r\\nwho came to see her at intervals, a very handsome young gentleman, and\\r\\nwho seemed very good. He was very kind to her, and she often saw him\\r\\nwatching her. One day when his mamma (who was a widow) had gone out, he\\r\\nmade love to her, and soon after he asked her to be engaged to him: she\\r\\nwished to ask the permission of her mistress, but he would not hear of\\r\\nit; she would never consent he said, and one day he persuaded her to\\r\\nelope with him, and in the end, after a long struggle between duty and\\r\\ninclination, she gave way.And here it appeared the young lady had[Pg 262] broken down in tears, and Paul had\\r\\nsoothed her, and vowed eternal love, like a weak, infatuated, silly\\r\\nfellow that he was. We almost question whether, had she told him the\\r\\nwhole truth of her life, he would not have done just the same.She soon discovered that her husband was a bad man, a gambler, and\\r\\neverything that was wicked, and she went to his mother to beg her\\r\\nforgiveness, and asked to be taken back as her servant. The old lady\\r\\nhad ordered her to be turned out of the house, and her husband laughed\\r\\nand jeered at her when she related the incident to him. She had never\\r\\nreally loved him, but had hoped to have a home, and to find peace, and\\r\\nshe tried to love him, and was a faithful true wife to him; but oh, he\\r\\nled such a life! he was a cheat, a forger, everything that was bad, and\\r\\nnot the old lady’s son after all, but the son of her first husband, who\\r\\nwas a dissipated man, and had died of delirium tremens.How Paul pitied her! O, if she had not been married! he had\\r\\nexclaimed in his ecstacy, as he[Pg\\r\\n263] looked into her deep eyes, and nursed her hand in his.She sighed at this, and wept again, and said there was something yet\\r\\nwhich she had not told him. Some day he should know all. Meanwhile she\\r\\nwas so good, so kind, so affectionate. Mrs. Dibble even went so far as\\r\\nto say that if she had not been brought up at a boarding-school, she\\r\\nought to have been, for her manners were quite boarding-school, and her\\r\\ndisposition was heavenly.Paul sent her books of poems, and novels, and all sorts of works,\\r\\nto read, that she might be amused and improve her mind; and it was\\r\\nastonishing how rapidly the young lady mastered their contents, and how\\r\\nably she used the sentiments of some of those poems that were full of\\r\\nlove and tenderness. It was surely native inborn tact this. The cynic\\r\\nwould say that all women have it; that nature has given them cunning\\r\\ninstead of physical strength. What a woman this would have been with\\r\\na good education![Pg 264]\\r\\nWhat a woman with the French language on her tongue! The judgment of\\r\\nShuffleton Gibbs when he sat in the show and thought he could make a\\r\\nfortune by her cleverness at cards, was that of a shrewd observer,\\r\\nthough he had been disappointed.What happy days these were to the Lieutenant, what happy hours,\\r\\nthese stolen intervals, as Chrissy got better. Chrissy she had always\\r\\nbeen called she said, and that was nearer the truth than any other\\r\\nword she had spoken; for that old clown who taught her to read and\\r\\nwrite, had called her Chris in those wild days of her childhood. With\\r\\ngood treatment and comfort, she had soon recovered her strength,\\r\\nand the roses came back to her cheeks, the roundness to her arms,\\r\\nand the brightness to her eyes. There was a little vulgarity in her\\r\\nappearance, and in her manners. The red in her cheeks was not of a\\r\\ndelicate rosy hue, and her voice could not be called musical. Her nose\\r\\nwas anything but classical,—not that we care for classical noses;\\r\\nno,[Pg 265] nor for\\r\\nclassical foreheads either for that matter. To Paul Somerton Chrissy\\r\\nwas beautiful, and that which you would call vulgar he looked upon\\r\\nas frankness and innocence, which charmed him all the more on that\\r\\naccount.Mr. Williamson soon had a surfeit of all this. The Lieutenant became\\r\\nquite a bore to him, and as obstinate as a mule. He would take no\\r\\nadvice, and listen to no arguments that in any way interfered with his\\r\\nwild idea of living with this woman in some distant land. That special\\r\\nfeature of interest in the woman’s history which had, as you will\\r\\nremember, brought up the name of Shuffleton Gibbs, soon disappeared;\\r\\nfor Chrissy had described to Paul a young and dashing fellow as her\\r\\nhusband, and they had both taken the description as true of course. The\\r\\nLieutenant might have asked Macshawser what sort of a fellow Crawley\\r\\nwas; but neither he nor the clever barrister thought of this, or if\\r\\nthey had, perhaps the Lieutenant would have put his veto upon such a\\r\\ncourse, seeing that it might in[Pg\\r\\n266] some way have led to the detection of Paul as Chrissy’s\\r\\nprotector.Now, Mr. Arundel Williamson had been hit in some escapade of his\\r\\nyouth in which a married woman was concerned; and it was this you\\r\\nknow which excited his sympathy so much for Paul, or he would long\\r\\nsince have shunned that young gentleman’s society, though the fellows\\r\\nat the club to which the barrister belonged liked the Lieutenant\\r\\nfor his pleasant, outspoken, honest manners, his free and easy and\\r\\nunsophisticated ways, and the perfect absence of military snobbism\\r\\nwhich was characteristic of him. But a good deal of this was assumed as\\r\\na sort of standing argument against the barrister’s advice to Paul to\\r\\ngive up his schemes with regard to the lady whom he loved so much, and\\r\\nremember that his duty to his family, to himself, aye, and to the army,\\r\\nwas to avoid a disgraceful liaison.Paul had once or twice become quite eloquent on this point, reminded\\r\\nthe barrister of his philosophy, quoted some of those very broad\\r\\nmaxims[Pg 267] which Mr.\\r\\nWilliamson had repeated in that little room in the Temple, talked of\\r\\nequality, and raved against all aristocratic assumption on the score of\\r\\nbirth and position. When the barrister replied, and endeavoured to show\\r\\nthat the Lieutenant was making use of arguments which did not apply to\\r\\nthe present case, Paul would hurl at him all kinds of absurd aphorisms\\r\\nabout love equalising all ranks, and then rave about his own birth—a\\r\\nbailiff’s son, sir!The only point upon which the barrister got the better of his\\r\\nfriend, was when he quietly rehearsed the penalties attendant upon\\r\\nthe crime of abduction, and more particularly the severity of the\\r\\npunishment which the law awarded to bigamy. Paul certainly retaliated\\r\\nwith the Divorce Court, but he found himself weak in the combat, very\\r\\nweak when the barrister talked of bigamy. The time came however when\\r\\nthat difficulty was at an end.Three months of this feverish and wicked dream of love had passed,\\r\\nand Paul had worshipped[Pg\\r\\n268] the idol which the fickle, cynical god, whom the classics\\r\\nsupposed to reign supreme in affairs of the heart, had set up. How the\\r\\nrosy youth must have laughed (not in his sleeve, for he never had any\\r\\nsleeves according to the painters) at the simplicity of this young\\r\\nfellow who wore Her Majesty’s uniform! Perhaps Asmodeo was the true\\r\\ngod after all; the lame monster with his goat legs, his long visage,\\r\\nhis sharp chin, and his demoniacal eyes and mouth, is certainly a more\\r\\nfitting spirit to preside over some of Love’s entanglements than he\\r\\nof the gilded wings and the quiver full of arrows. But he boasted of\\r\\nassuming whatever shape he willed, and confessed that it was necessary\\r\\nto look well sometimes; Vice never pleased half so well unless it had a\\r\\nfair appearance.Lieutenant Somerton did not dream of gods at all in the matter, and\\r\\nhe would not have indulged his fancy upon such a cynical fellow as\\r\\nAsmodeo for a moment; he was in love, over head and ears, madly in love\\r\\nwith this woman,[Pg 269]\\r\\nwho thrust that wooden spoon into the bowl at the roadside inn, and\\r\\nate her share of the repast like—well, like a vagabond, as she was,\\r\\nyou know, in the eyes of the law—like a rogue and vagabond; for the\\r\\nlaw combines the two in its harsh description of the poor stroller.\\r\\nThe Lieutenant would surely have been disenchanted if Signor Asmodeo\\r\\nhad taken the bandage from his eyes and shown him that incident in the\\r\\npast; or that little scene in the show when Mr. Shuffleton Gibbs, his\\r\\ndire enemy, had made love to her, and succeeded in his suit.What a clever girl she was! The god “so gloriously celebrated by\\r\\nAgrippa and the Clavicula Salomonis,” and his friend Don Cleofas\\r\\nwould have been delighted with her. His Spanish majesty would surely\\r\\nhave painted her image on his cloak, and illustrated her curious and\\r\\nbrilliant career!One fine summer evening, when a gentle rain had washed the dust out\\r\\nof the two trees which lived out a shambling sort of existence at the\\r\\nback[Pg 270] of the house\\r\\nwhere Mrs. Dibble consented to act the part of guardian to that poor\\r\\npersecuted orphan, whom she loved as if she were her own—on a bright\\r\\nsummer evening when the sun was shining out after the rain, and a\\r\\nrefreshing breeze came up the Thames and moved the leaves of the trees\\r\\nin question, Chrissy leaned upon Paul Somerton’s shoulder, and told him\\r\\nthat she must leave him on the next day. She was now quite well, she\\r\\nsaid, and her gratitude to him for his great kindness compelled her to\\r\\ntake this course. His honourable and respectful conduct towards her,\\r\\nand her love for him, too, all urged departure. She had deceived him,\\r\\ndeceived him wickedly, and had never until now felt courage enough to\\r\\ntell him how much she had wronged him.Paul grew terribly alarmed at her earnest words, and begged her not\\r\\nto tell him, not to talk of leaving him. Where could she go? He could\\r\\nnot live without her. O, that cursed marriage! O cruel Fate that had\\r\\nnot brought her to him in the days of her early life! It seemed to\\r\\nhim,[Pg 271] he said, that\\r\\nhe had known her always. Her face was familiar to him when first he\\r\\nsaw her. Paul had often said this, and poor Chrissy felt satisfied in\\r\\nher own mind that he must have seen that mysterious lady of the Temple\\r\\nof Magic; but, of course, she never assisted his memory one jot, and\\r\\nif memory had given him a quiet nudge in connection with his visit to\\r\\nSeverntown with Mrs. Dibble, he would have repudiated the suggestion\\r\\nwith scorn.When he exclaimed, O that cursed marriage! Chrissy held down her\\r\\nhead and sighed and wept and murmured out some pathetic words of Thomas\\r\\nMoore’s about forgiveness. She had rehearsed this point before Mrs.\\r\\nDibble’s glass, and had committed the words to memory for the purpose\\r\\na week previously. She knew that Paul could not marry her because she was Crawley’s wife; she knew that a divorce was\\r\\na serious business, and that it might lead to the exposure of her real\\r\\nhistory. So she had resolved, the first week she was in Paul’s care,\\r\\nthat when she was[Pg 272]\\r\\nonce firmly secure of his love, she would make a pathetic confession of\\r\\nbeing single, and then fall at his feet and implore his forgiveness.How cleverly she did this it is unnecessary to say. It was a\\r\\nsplendid success; the confession jumped so well with the Lieutenant’s\\r\\nwishes that he blotted out the past at once, forgave her, and in his\\r\\nblind mad fashion felt perfectly happy. He went to his quarters that\\r\\nnight determined to exchange into a regiment that was abroad or going\\r\\nabroad, and marry this poor girl, who had been so wronged, and who\\r\\nhad knelt at his feet until his heart ached for her, and whose future\\r\\nhappiness he vowed should be his continual care.Mrs. Dibble had told dear Chrissy that she expected her husband\\r\\ncoming to spend a day with them in the course of a fortnight; and as\\r\\nthe chatty, old woman had told dear Chrissy how she had found poor\\r\\nThomas with a set of nasty, dirty show people, dear Chrissy thought\\r\\nit best to bring her grand scheme of a new start in life to[Pg 273] an early conclusion. O,\\r\\nhow she would love to go to India or anywhere beyond the seas, where\\r\\nshe could begin her life anew, and prove to her dear, dear Paul, the\\r\\ndepth of woman’s gratitude and love!The preparations for the marriage of Lord Verner to Miss Tallant\\r\\ngradually drew towards completion, and the fashionable world was\\r\\nall agog at the event. The newspapers had published all kinds of\\r\\npiquant paragraphs about the beauty of the bride, her great wealth,\\r\\nthe nobility of her birth, and the immense riches of the bridegroom.\\r\\nIntroduced by the popular gossip-preface on dit, the Court\\r\\nJournal and Court Circular had fairly vied with each other\\r\\nin racy scraps about Montem Castle and Barton Hall. A journal devoted\\r\\nto the fine arts had made the discovery that many of the landscapes by\\r\\nthe now famous artist, Arthur Phillips, were copies of the glorious\\r\\nscenery in[Pg 275] that\\r\\nbeautiful valley of Avonworth where Barton Hall was situated.Local newspapers dug up from local histories and elsewhere anecdotes\\r\\nof the Verners, and expressed their belief that his lordship the\\r\\npresent Earl would now take his place at the head of the county, and\\r\\nmix in society, as his noble father had done before him. It was,\\r\\nindeed, confidently stated that this would be the effect of his\\r\\nlordship’s marriage, and the county was congratulated upon the event\\r\\nin a hearty, manful style. One journalist, evidently with the fear of\\r\\nLondon and Punch and Eatanswill before him, came out in a very\\r\\nexplanatory sketch, in which he ventured to point out how legitimate\\r\\nit was that county people should make a fuss on the occasion of\\r\\nthis marriage, and how proper it was that the newspapers should set\\r\\nforth the event as one of great importance. It was all very well for\\r\\nLondon people to think lightly of such things; but Londoners were\\r\\naltogether differently placed. They made fuss enough on the occasion of\\r\\nroyal[Pg 276] marriages,\\r\\nand filled their newspapers with orange-blossom articles. In a city\\r\\nlike Severntown the nobility were mixed up with the social, political,\\r\\nand religious welfare of the place. The citizens rejoiced in having\\r\\nsuch neighbours, and it was right that they should acknowledge the\\r\\ndignity and worth of their native aristocracy. In the present instance\\r\\nthe union of an Earl of Verner with the daughter of a woman of the\\r\\nhouse of Petherington, and daughter of the late Christopher Tallant, a\\r\\nmerchant prince, was an event of importance not only to the county of\\r\\nSevernshire but to England. The provincial editor, though he might feel\\r\\nthat he was saying nothing silly, nor anything smacking of toadyism,\\r\\nthought it judicious once more in this place to contrast the difference\\r\\nbetween provincial editors and London editors. The latter might think\\r\\nit fine to laugh at enthusiastic provincials, but Londoners could\\r\\nnot possibly enter into the feelings which must necessarily animate\\r\\na provincial community on an occasion like the present. [Pg 277]Londoners who did not\\r\\ntalk politics, and could not understand the intense excitement of an\\r\\nelection, did not know what it was to live in a restricted community\\r\\nassociated with noble and wealthy families who possessed means and\\r\\nfacilities for being of the greatest social benefit to those amongst\\r\\nwhom they lived.Our friend got a little involved at this point of his elaborate\\r\\njustification of himself. There was so much of special pleading in\\r\\nhis article that the intelligent reader might not unfairly think\\r\\nthat he knew he was toadying a little, and was fighting an attack by\\r\\nanticipation. In one portion of his article he was very bitter; he said\\r\\nthat the London newspaper-men, who professed to look down from the\\r\\ngreatest heights upon provincials, were provincials themselves. Then\\r\\nhe claimed all the best men in town as countrymen, and vowed that all\\r\\nthe most noteworthy magazine articles were written by provincials. How\\r\\nthe editor drifted into this irrelevant discussion was curious to note;\\r\\nhow he got back again to the[Pg\\r\\n278] subject in hand was a marvel of literary art. He finished\\r\\nby showing how the marriages of the great influenced the destinies of\\r\\na nation, and he went back to the remotest times for illustrations of\\r\\nthis important point.Even at the risk of involving the narrative, we pause to tell the\\r\\nreader that the provincial thunderer in question has since succeeded\\r\\nin obtaining an appointment in town, and that he has begun already\\r\\nto look down from his high tower upon his humbler brethren of the\\r\\nSevernshire press; indeed, he is said to be the writer of that amusing\\r\\nsatirical tract on “Mrs. Grundy’s Borough,” which lampoons so smartly\\r\\nthe society, public and private, of the old city. Well, “circumstances\\r\\nalter cases,” as the Severntown Mercury wisely remarked in\\r\\nreviewing that offensive publication, which took the old city and\\r\\nthe post-office by storm one morning not very long ago. The London\\r\\nprovincial gentleman, if he be living now (and we hope he is living\\r\\nhappily and prosperously), will we trust forgive our allusion to[Pg 279] this incident; he may say\\r\\nthat it is more irrelevant to this history than that passage in his\\r\\narticle to the subject discussed. Perhaps he is right; we bow to his\\r\\nopinion with all deference. We can assure him that we should not have\\r\\nmentioned him at all, only that our story seemed to demand it. Honestly\\r\\nendeavouring to place these records of modern history fairly before the\\r\\nreader, we could not, without something like a breach of faith, have\\r\\nexcluded the journalistic features of the union of the houses of Verner\\r\\nand Tallant, and particularly when we consider the consequences of that\\r\\ninteresting and delightful marriage.It would appear that when the Hon. Elizabeth Petherington married\\r\\nChristopher Tallant, Esq., her family had discarded her. Being of high\\r\\nand noble birth, the other ladies of her family had not approved of\\r\\nthe marriage, and when the male head of the Petheringtons died, the\\r\\nfemale tails cut themselves off from the wife of the merchant prince;\\r\\nso that neither Phœbe nor Amy had ever[Pg 280] heard from the Petheringtons, and\\r\\nMiss Tallant, in fact, knew nothing of them until she received a\\r\\nfriendly and affectionate letter from Lady Petherington, reminding\\r\\nher of the relationship, and desiring that she might be by her niece’s side at the wedding. This renewal of family\\r\\nfriendship resulted in the broken threads of other links being gathered\\r\\ntogether, and as those hymeneal paragraphs continued to appear in the\\r\\nfashionable newspapers, there opened up to the bride elect quite a\\r\\nparty of relatives and friends, who came and visited her shortly before\\r\\nthe time fixed for the wedding; so that all of a sudden Barton Hall\\r\\nbecame quite gay with visitors, and Phœbe was invited to come\\r\\namongst her dear friend’s newly-found relations. Phœbe feared\\r\\nat first that she might be embarrassed in such high society; but she\\r\\nwas not in the least, and Miss Tallant complimented her upon her\\r\\nbeauty and her charming manners. As for Amy, she received her guests\\r\\nwith the most graceful dignity, though her aunt, Lady Petherington,\\r\\nwas piqued and[Pg 281]\\r\\nannoyed at the high tone of her niece. Her ladyship confessed to her\\r\\nsister that the young woman actually patronised her—she was sure of\\r\\nit; she had never met with such audacity. The poor thing was certainly\\r\\nrather good-looking and dreadfully rich, she believed—shockingly\\r\\nrich—so she supposed they must put up with her airs. The Verners were\\r\\nan old family, and wealthy, too, she said, and no doubt his lordship\\r\\nwas marrying for money. What he could see in the young woman beyond\\r\\nthat, of course, she was at a loss to know. The sister did not quite\\r\\nagree with her ladyship; she vowed she thought the young person very\\r\\ntolerable indeed, very tolerable; of course it did not concern her\\r\\nwhether she were so or otherwise. An introduction to Earl Verner’s\\r\\nset—for of course he would go thoroughly into society now—was all she\\r\\ncared for, coupled with one month in the year at Montem Castle.During their stay his lordship sent over carriages to convey them\\r\\nto Montem, where he gave them a magnificent entertainment, and showed\\r\\nthem[Pg 282] his house and\\r\\ngrounds. Miss Somerton was of the party, much to the disappointment of\\r\\nArthur Phillips, who had come over on that day to sketch a particular\\r\\nspot which Phœbe loved.Lady Petherington and her sister (who, by the way, were both grey,\\r\\nif the truth had been known, and wore false teeth) made themselves\\r\\nparticularly amiable at Montem, and the eldest (Amy said she was\\r\\nfifty, at least) was by no means comfortable under what she called the\\r\\nignorantly patronising airs of Miss Tallant. We fear Amy did not intend\\r\\nto enhance the happiness of Lady Petherington’s visits.“They only came, your lordship,” she said to the Earl, when they\\r\\nwere alone for a few minutes in the gardens, “they only came because I\\r\\nam going to be a countess.”“Good, good,” said his lordship, swinging his eye-glass round, and\\r\\nlooking admiringly at the fine woman who was laughing and chatting so\\r\\neasily.“It is true. I never heard of them until the[Pg 283] other day: they cut my poor mother\\r\\nfor marrying a commoner. Fancy, your lordship, only fancy Lady Mary\\r\\nPetherington cutting any one!”Amy laughed quite bewitchingly at the idea of any one caring what\\r\\nopinion Lady Mary Petherington might have concerning them.“There! Now I know you will think me shockingly ungrateful, after\\r\\nthey have condescended so much,” went on the merry girl, patting his\\r\\nlordship’s hand with her fan, and flashing her big dark eyes upon\\r\\nhim.“What a merry laugh it is; it does one’s heart good,” said his\\r\\nlordship, offering Miss Tallant his arm, and leading her away at the\\r\\nsound of approaching footsteps.“These ladies have only come to make your lordship’s acquaintance,\\r\\nnot mine; they have determined to spend long visits at Montem Castle. I\\r\\nsaw Lady Mary choosing her room when she was looking at those beautiful\\r\\napartments on the first floor. I did indeed,” she went on, and\\r\\nthen[Pg 284] she laughed\\r\\nagain, and Lord Verner laughed, and said the Countess was full of\\r\\nfun.Whether it was fun or not, he said the Countess of Verner should\\r\\nselect her own guests, and at this moment their ladyships and\\r\\nPhœbe joined them on the terrace.A few minutes afterwards, when Phœbe and the future Countess\\r\\nwent up-stairs to put on their shawls, Miss Tallant sat down wearily\\r\\nin the first chair that presented itself, wearied and jaded with the\\r\\npart she had been playing. What a fine actress she would have made; her\\r\\nrôle would have included all the glorious women of the drama,\\r\\nfrom “Lady Teazle” to “Constance” in King John.The title of Chapter VII in the table of\\r\\ncontents was changed from “HIMSELF IT ANOTHER CHARACTER” to\\r\\n“HIMSELF IN ANOTHER CHARACTER.”Page 123: “will and testament of Mr. Richard\\r\\nTallant” changed to “will and testament of Mr.\\r\\nChristopher Tallant”.The miseries of Varna, the unparalleled sufferings of the troops before\\r\\nSebastopol, and the awful blunder of Balaclava give testimony to the\\r\\nunwisdom of the selections.During the long peace since Waterloo the army had grown unpopular. It\\r\\nhad been neglected. Even the Duke of Wellington was averse to making any\\r\\nmilitary display for fear that what army there was should be further\\r\\nreduced.The force which left England for the East was one of the worst equipped\\r\\n{viii}and most badly organised that ever left our shores. On the contrary,\\r\\nthe men of which it was composed were the finest. They were all\\r\\nlong-service men, of grand physique and of an unrivalled spirit.Before the Crimean war a red coat was looked on with disdain; after the\\r\\nwar the wearer was hailed as a friend. He had proved that he was a\\r\\nworthy descendant of the heroes of the Peninsula, that he could perform\\r\\nas gallant deeds on the blood-stained slopes of the Alma or in the\\r\\nvalley of Balaclava as had his forebears at Waterloo, that he could die\\r\\nof disease and starvation as uncomplainingly before Sebastopol as did\\r\\nhis predecessors in Spain or Portugal.In the following pages the author has endeavoured to pay a small tribute\\r\\nto the heroism of the rank and file, and to show how they won for\\r\\nthemselves in the hearts of the British public the warm place they have\\r\\never since occupied.The survivors of the Crimean war are, alas! growing yearly fewer; but\\r\\nthe author desires to acknowledge with thankfulness much information he\\r\\nhas gained from the veterans he has had the opportunity of knowing,\\r\\namongst whom he wishes specially to mention Sergeant James Mustard, of\\r\\nthe 17th Lancers, a survivor of the immortal charge, and happily still\\r\\nalive.He also wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the fascinating pages\\r\\nof Kinglake’s Invasion of the Crimea and Russell’s British Expedition\\r\\nto the Crimea. Stirling’s Highland Brigade in the Crimea, and\\r\\nSteven’s Connaught Rangers have also been advantageously consulted.I shivered again when I read of the awful storm of November and of the\\r\\nmiseries of the road to Balaclava. My heart beat with pride at the tale\\r\\nof Inkermann, so well is the story told.Many of the characters in the story I recognise—Jack Blair, Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore, Sergeant Linham, Captain Norreys, Pearson, Brandon, and so\\r\\non. I knew them under different names in the old regiment, but they were\\r\\nthe same men.If any boy is interested in what we did, what we suffered, and what part\\r\\nin the Crimean war my regiment played, let him read Blair of\\r\\nBalaclava.{x} As a survivor of the Light Brigade I can truly say that had\\r\\nMr Lynn soldiered with me and ridden by my side in the charge he could\\r\\nnot have given a truer account of our doings in the Crimea in 1854 and\\r\\n1855.Sergeant James Mustard, the writer of the fore-going letter, was born in\\r\\nSt James’s, Piccadilly, on January 13th, 1829.Coming of a family of soldiers, a love for the profession of arms was\\r\\nborn in him, and he joined the 3rd Light Dragoons, in London, on May\\r\\n1st, 1850. Two years later he transferred, at Canterbury, to the 17th\\r\\nLancers.He went out to the East with his regiment in April 1854, was present at\\r\\nthe affair of the Bulganak and the battle of the Alma. He rode in the\\r\\nfront rank of the ‘Immortal Six Hundred,’ going down the valley\\r\\nimmediately behind Lord Cardigan and his orderly trumpeter, Brittain of\\r\\nthe 17th Lancers, who died of his wounds received in the charge. He\\r\\nreached the guns in safety, and, after using his lance with good effect\\r\\nagainst the Russian gunners and the cavalry formed behind them, started,\\r\\nwith a little group of his own regiment and the 8th Hussars, on the\\r\\nreturn ride. He had a personal encounter with a Polish Lancer, whom he\\r\\nworsted; then continuing on his way, went to the assistance of Trumpeter\\r\\nLandfried of the 17th, who came safely out of the fray.Sergeant Mustard had received a severe wound;{xi} but owing to the intense\\r\\nexcitement became aware of the fact only by accident. To describe this\\r\\nevent the writer quotes the sergeant’s own words: ‘We were coming back\\r\\nalong the valley when a chum of the 13th Light Dragoons, named Hetridge,\\r\\nrode up to me. “Jim,” he said, “lend me your sword, for I’ve lost mine\\r\\nin the fight.” I still held my lance, though the shaft had been chipped\\r\\nby a bullet. I turned to draw my sword to hand it to Hetridge, when, to\\r\\nmy amazement, I found I had neither sword, scabbard, nor belt. A\\r\\ncanister-shot had caught me on the left hip, and cut away sword, belt,\\r\\noveralls, and pants, and laid bare a great red patch of bleeding flesh.\\r\\nAnother inch would have smashed my hip and killed me.’After lying all night on the ground, and helping to shift camp twice,\\r\\nSergeant Mustard was next day sent to Scutari hospital, where he spent\\r\\nthe next four months.He served till the end of the war; and, returning with his regiment, was\\r\\nstationed in Ireland till the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. Going to\\r\\nIndia, he served in Sir William Gordon’s squadron in the pursuit and\\r\\ncapture of Tantia Topee. He was again wounded, and had his horse shot\\r\\nunder him. Among his officers at that date were Lieut.-General Sir D. C.\\r\\nDrury Lowe, G.C.B., and Field-Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood, V.C., G.C.B.,\\r\\nboth then regimental officers in the 17th Lancers.Sergeant Mustard, after being master-tailor of his regiment, retired\\r\\nfrom the service in 1865, being the possessor of the Crimean medal with\\r\\nthree clasps, the Turkish medal, and the Indian Mutiny medal with one\\r\\nclasp.{xii}The old veteran is still hale and hearty, though the only survivor of\\r\\nthe rank and file of his regiment who rode in the charge. The kindly\\r\\nface and upright, soldierly figure, with the glittering medals on his\\r\\nbreast, are well known in the suburb where he has lived, greatly\\r\\nrespected, ever since he left the service.His grandfather and two uncles fought at Waterloo in the 71st Light\\r\\nInfantry, and two of his brothers served for many years in the 22nd\\r\\nRegiment.{xiii}‘I couldn’t help it, Jenkins; it was quite an accident. Your foot was\\r\\nstuck out, and I stumbled over it.’As he spoke, the lanky, pale-faced youth rose from the table, where he\\r\\nhad been sitting nibbling the end of a quill, and soundly boxed the ears\\r\\nof a small, delicate-looking boy who, while carrying an inkpot across\\r\\nthe office, had stumbled and upset some of the black fluid upon the\\r\\nlavender-coloured continuations of Mr Silvester Jenkins.Not content with boxing the boy’s ears, Mr Jenkins seized him by the\\r\\narm, which he twisted savagely.The scene was taking place in the close and dismal office of Messrs\\r\\nPhogg & Cheetham, Solicitors, House{2} Agents, &c. The tiny windows,\\r\\npartly covered with a wire blind and partly with big bills, allowed but\\r\\nlittle daylight to penetrate into the office, Messrs Phogg & Cheetham\\r\\nseeming to prefer, in more senses than one, working in the dark.While the boy’s cries still rang out, a third person, who had been\\r\\nseated in the darkest corner of the office, perched up on a high stool,\\r\\nmaking entries in a book of vast dimensions, quietly descended from his\\r\\nseat, and in two strides stood before Mr Jenkins.This third person was a well-set-up, handsome young fellow of about\\r\\nsixteen, with a firm chin, clear-cut features, and honest hazel eyes.A slight flush crept into Blair’s cheeks, and Jenkins gave Mallinson’s\\r\\narm another twist that made the poor boy almost shriek with pain. This\\r\\nwas more than the quick temper of Jack Blair could stand.The pent-up animosity of months broke out; and, never pausing to\\r\\nconsider the probable consequences of his act, or to remember that the\\r\\ndandified being before him was his master’s nephew, he caught Mr Jenkins\\r\\nby the collar, shook him as a terrier would a rat, then hurled him\\r\\nacross the office, where he fell with a crash in the fireplace.Picking himself up, with a snarl of rage Jenkins seized a heavy ebony\\r\\nruler, which he aimed with all his might at Blair. It struck that youth\\r\\na sharp{3} blow on the head, making him see stars for a moment, then\\r\\nglanced off and smashed one of the small, dirty panes of glass in the\\r\\nwindow.Mr Jenkins’ triumph was, however, but short-lived. Roused to fury by the\\r\\nsting of the blow, Blair stepped up to the angry bully, his right and\\r\\nleft shot out with lightning-like rapidity; and, receiving one on his\\r\\nmouth and one on his ample nose, Mr Jenkins measured his length upon the\\r\\nfloor again, where he lay like a whipped cur, shouting ‘Murder!’ and\\r\\n‘Police!’In the midst of the hubbub, a door which led to the private office of Mr\\r\\nPhogg opened, and a tall, thin, black-bearded man appeared in the\\r\\ndoorway. He gave a rapid look round the office, readjusted his\\r\\ngold-rimmed spectacles, took another look, then asked in cutting tones,\\r\\n‘What is the meaning of this low, disgraceful conduct?’Mr Jenkins picked himself up from the floor, holding his coloured silk\\r\\nhandkerchief to his nose; little Mallinson shrank back into a corner;\\r\\nwhile Blair put his hands in his trouser-pockets with a resigned air,\\r\\nknowing there was trouble ahead for him, but determined to meet it\\r\\nboldly.‘Now then,’ rapped out Mr Phogg, ‘must I ask again what is the meaning\\r\\nof this outrage perpetrated upon the premises of one of the oldest and\\r\\nmost respectable businesses in Wycombe?’‘It’s that low fellow Blair,’ said Mr Jenkins; ‘he made a savage attack\\r\\nupon me. He’s a bully and a coward. He tried to murder me.’‘Now, John Blair,’ said Mr Phogg coldly, ‘what explanation have you got?\\r\\nBe careful what you say, for you may yet find yourself in the\\r\\npolice-court, and{4} any admission now, although spoken in hot blood, may\\r\\nbe used against you.’‘I have no explanation,’ he said shortly; ‘ask your nephew for his\\r\\nversion. I dare say it will be more to your taste than mine would be.’Mr Phogg gave a sort of gasp—that is, he opened his mouth like a fish\\r\\nsuddenly taken from the water, but he made no sound. Astonishment kept\\r\\nhim silent. Had he heard aright? Had John Blair, the junior clerk, the\\r\\nyouth who was dependent on his bounty, the ungrateful being whom he fed\\r\\nand lodged and paid—had he dared to be impudent to him, Anthony\\r\\nPhogg, senior partner of the firm of Phogg and Cheetham?He paused for a moment; then a kind of painful smile crossed his\\r\\nfeatures. ‘Very well, Silvester,’ he said, ‘very well; proceed with\\r\\nyour narrative. Relate the facts;’ and he sat on the edge of the high\\r\\nstool Blair had just vacated, folding his arms and stretching out his\\r\\nlong legs before him.‘Nothing libellous, please,’ said Mr Phogg, holding up one lean, yellow\\r\\nhand; ‘plain facts only. I will draw my own conclusions.’‘Well, sir, Mallinson then, crossing the office just now, deliberately\\r\\nupset an inkpot on my trousers, completely spoiling them.’‘We can recover the value if we find motive,’ said Mr Phogg, making a\\r\\npencil note on a scrap of paper lying on Blair’s desk. ‘Proceed.’‘I was just showing Mallinson what he had done,{5} and was telling him to\\r\\nbe more careful another time, when he began cheeking me’——‘He has been most insolent ever since he got that new job and gave us\\r\\nnotice. I was checking him for being chee—insolent, when that bully\\r\\nBlair seized his ruler, rushed at me, and attacked me like a mad-man. I\\r\\nstruggled to get the ruler from him, when he threw it at me and smashed\\r\\nthe window, afterwards punching me about the face like a prize-fighter.\\r\\nJust look at me.’ And indeed Mr Jenkins did look in a pretty plight,\\r\\nwith one eye nearly closed, his nose swollen, his mouth cut, and his\\r\\nhands smeared with blacklead and soot off the grate.‘Ha,’ said Mr Phogg, ‘just what I expected! You are a low, common bully,\\r\\nBlair; a worthless, lazy brat, whom I kept only out of charity,’ he\\r\\ncontinued, his thin lips curling back from his teeth as he spoke. ‘Now\\r\\nyou shall go—do you hear?—you shall go, be bundled, without a\\r\\nreference, neck and crop out into the gutter, where you can starve, or\\r\\nsell matches, or thieve. I dare say you’re a thief as well as’——‘Stop!’ cried Blair, his eyes flashing fire. ‘Discharge me you can; but\\r\\ninsult me you shall not. I am ready to go, for I’m sick to death of this\\r\\nplace and its shady business, of you and your ape of a nephew. Give me\\r\\nmy money and I’ll go at once.’‘Oh Mr Phogg, please, please!’ cried poor little Mallinson, coming\\r\\nforward and holding out his hands appealingly; ‘it wasn’t Blair’s fault,\\r\\non my honour it wasn’t. Jenkins—Mr Jenkins, I mean—boxed my ears and\\r\\npinched me, and twisted my arm till I had to scream, I couldn’t help it.\\r\\nAnd I didn’t upset the ink on him on purpose. Blair only interfered\\r\\nbecause{6} Mr Jenkins was hurting me, and he’s always at it, and Blair\\r\\ntold him last time he wouldn’t have any more of it. Oh, please, Mr\\r\\nPhogg, don’t sack Blair.’‘Silence, you little sneak!’ roared Mr Phogg; ‘leave the house, and\\r\\ndepend upon it I’ll mention this occurrence in the character I shall\\r\\ngive you.—Silvester, come into my room.’Mr Phogg and his worthy nephew disappeared into the inner sanctum\\r\\ntogether; then Blair and Mallinson looked at one another, the latter\\r\\nalmost on the verge of tears.‘Oh Blair, what shall I do? It’s all my fault, and now you’ll have to\\r\\ngo. I shall never, never forgive myself. What shall I do?’‘Don’t you worry, Cecil,’ he said; ‘it isn’t your fault. Ever since you\\r\\ngot that nomination for Lidsdale’s Bank and gave Phogg notice to leave\\r\\nthey’ve been down on you and me. There was bound to be a row, and I’m\\r\\nglad it’s over. I could not have stopped here much longer. I feel as\\r\\nthough the very air of this office, with its pettifogging business, and\\r\\ndark, underhand methods, would choke me. I’m glad the burst-up has come.\\r\\nNow, cut away home, and I’ll give you a look up in the morning on the\\r\\nway to church.’‘But—but—aren’t you afraid to be left here with those?’ and he pointed\\r\\nto the door of the private room.‘What! not gone, Mallinson?’ he cried. ‘Put on your hat at once. Here’s\\r\\nyour money. Now go,{7} and never darken my doors again!’ and, giving the\\r\\nboy a small envelope, he bundled him out of the door, which he banged\\r\\nbehind him.Blair did as he was bidden; then climbed up on to his high stool, and\\r\\nsat looking at the brilliant sunlight outside. His mind wandered back\\r\\ntwelve months—to his old school and the pleasant cricket-meadow where\\r\\nprobably the fellows were then playing, or perhaps his own old\\r\\nparticular chums were having a pull up the river. The recollection made\\r\\nhim sigh, for the last twelve months had held nothing but trouble and\\r\\nhard work for him. He looked round the dismal office, seeming ten times\\r\\nmore dismal, he thought, now young Mallinson had gone, and his head fell\\r\\nforward on his hands, for the future looked dark indeed before him.Less than fifteen months ago he had lost his father. At the end of the\\r\\nsummer term he had gone home to find his mother and sisters removed from\\r\\nthe great, rambling old house in Hampshire, where he had been born, to a\\r\\nhumble lodging in London. There nothing but bad news met him. Mr Bailey,\\r\\nthe old lawyer who had managed his father’s business for years, had\\r\\nstated that Mr Blair’s affairs were in a far from flourishing state.\\r\\nUnfortunate speculations had dissipated his fortune; his property was\\r\\nmortgaged, and most of his securities had to be disposed of to meet his\\r\\nliabilities. The house and best part of the furniture were sold, and the\\r\\nproceeds, being invested, were just sufficient to bring in a bare\\r\\npittance, enough to keep a roof over the widow’s head. Jack Blair had to\\r\\nturn out into the world to earn his own living.{8}His first place had been in a wholesale drapery establishment, where he\\r\\nworked twelve hours a day. The hard work and the confinement, together\\r\\nwith the bad and insufficient food, had in a few months made him but a\\r\\nghost of his former self, and his mother had insisted upon his leaving.\\r\\nHis second situation had been with a firm of merchants who in less than\\r\\ntwo months went bankrupt, and Jack Blair was once more thrown on his\\r\\nmother’s hands. Then the family lawyer had procured him his present\\r\\nsituation with Messrs Phogg & Cheetham, a place where he worked from\\r\\neight in the morning till eight or often nine at night, Saturdays\\r\\nincluded. He lived on the premises, and, besides his board, received the\\r\\nmagnificent sum of four shillings a week for his services.The old lawyer had told him that at any cost he must keep that\\r\\nsituation, as he must not be a burden to his mother, who had as much as\\r\\nshe could do to keep herself.Jack had determined to succeed, and in spite of drudgery and continual\\r\\nsnubs and insults, had been there six months; and now—well, after that\\r\\nafternoon’s work—he knew that his days there were numbered, and, worst\\r\\nof all, Mr Phogg had said he would not give him a reference. Jack knew\\r\\nhis employer’s vindictive nature too well to doubt that he would carry\\r\\nout his threat. He felt he could not write and tell his mother, and what\\r\\nto do he knew not.At eight o’clock that night he was turned out into the street, all his\\r\\nworldly possessions packed in a small portmanteau, a week’s wages (less\\r\\none shilling and fourpence stopped for the broken window) added to his\\r\\nsmall stock of money, seven shillings and{9} eightpence in all, forming\\r\\nthe whole of his wealth, for Jack had sent his mother half his slender\\r\\nearnings ever since he had been in his situation. He went straight to\\r\\nthe Mallinsons’ and arranged for a night’s lodging with them, he having\\r\\nbeen on very friendly terms with the family since he had been in\\r\\nWycombe.Early on the Sunday morning, Jack, portmanteau in hand, started on his\\r\\nlong tramp from Wycombe to London, for he decided he dared not spend the\\r\\ntwo and tenpence for the railway fare. Cecil accompanied Jack some\\r\\ndistance on the way, and when they parted he said, as he wrung Jack’s\\r\\nhand, ‘I can’t help feeling it’s all my fault your going.’‘Jenkins did look a guy,’ said Cecil, his eyes kindling at the\\r\\nrecollection of his tormentor’s humiliation.‘He looked just what he is, a sneaking bully,’ said Jack as he shook\\r\\nCecil’s hand; ‘and now, good-bye and prosperity to you in your new\\r\\nsituation.’At a steady four miles an hour Jack kept on, mile after mile, the\\r\\nexercise taking more effect on him than it otherwise would have done, as\\r\\nsince he had been at Wycombe he had enjoyed few opportunities of taking\\r\\nlong walks. A brief halt for some bread and cheese in the middle of the\\r\\nday, then on again, every mile seeming to get longer and longer while\\r\\nyet a good part of the journey was before him.Jack took off his coat, which he carried over his shoulder, changing his\\r\\nportmanteau from hand to{10} hand. The day was baking hot. The white road,\\r\\nan inch thick in dust, reflected back the glowing sun till it made his\\r\\neyes ache.Jack hobbled painfully, his heels being rubbed and blistered, while his\\r\\nportmanteau seemed to grow heavier with every yard he walked. He had\\r\\narrived at a spot where the hedge turned off at right angles, leading up\\r\\nto a five-barred gate opening on to some pasture-land. One side of this\\r\\nopening was in the shade, and, after looking at it for a moment, Jack\\r\\nturned up with a half-sigh of contentment and seated himself on the\\r\\nsloping, shady bank. He guessed he was somewhere near Hounslow, and he\\r\\nbegan to despair of reaching London that night. ‘Perhaps I could get a\\r\\ntrain from Hounslow,’ he thought; ‘but can I afford it?’He took from his pocket the little purse his eldest sister had given\\r\\nhim, and counted all his store—a half-crown, a florin, two shillings, a\\r\\nsixpence, and fivepence halfpenny in coppers—seven shillings and\\r\\nfivepence halfpenny in all. Jack sighed as he looked at the money in his\\r\\nhand and thought how short a way it would go when he was out of a\\r\\nsituation. He was replacing the coins in his purse when a rush of feet\\r\\nsounded near him. Three men burst through the hedge, and while one\\r\\nseized him by the collar, another ragged, unshaven rascal, holding a\\r\\nshort, heavy bludgeon in his hand, cried with a grin, ‘Evenin’, young\\r\\ngen’l’man, you’re the wery covey we’ve been a-waitin’ for. I’ll trouble\\r\\nyer to ‘and over them dibs, or’—and he flourished his\\r\\nstick—‘circumstances may be onpleasant.{11}’The man who had first seized him by the collar, a villainous,\\r\\nsquint-eyed, red-headed fellow, perceiving Jack’s determined manner,\\r\\ncried, ‘Now, none o’ that ‘ere; tip over the brass an’ that ticker ye’ve\\r\\ngot at the end o’ that chain, or I’ll knock yer brains out.’‘At ‘im, Toby,’ said he with the bludgeon in gruff tones. ‘We don’t want\\r\\nter stand ‘ere jawin’ till some one comes along.’ Uttering these words,\\r\\nhe ran in with upraised stick.Jack seized his small portmanteau and hurled it at the ruffian’s legs,\\r\\ncausing him not only to yell with pain at the sharp rap he got on his\\r\\nshins, but also to fall forward heavily on hands and knees. He uttered\\r\\nan oath, and cried out to his two companions to ‘finish the young\\r\\nwhelp.’Red-Head rushed in to do so; but Jack, who was a first-class boxer,\\r\\nhaving won the gloves on two occasions at his old school, gave the\\r\\nruffian an upper cut on the point of the chin which dashed his teeth\\r\\ntogether with a snap that sounded like the meeting{12} of the jaws of a\\r\\nrat-trap. The tramp badly bit his tongue, and he fell back, spitting out\\r\\nblood.Jack then started to run down towards the highroad, shouting, ‘Help!\\r\\nhelp! Thieves!’ at the top of his voice.He might have got safely away after all had it not been for tramp number\\r\\nthree. This scoundrel had hovered in the rear of his companions till he\\r\\nsaw Jack start off for the road, when, with a big stone which he had\\r\\npicked up, he set off in pursuit. He was lean and long-legged, and he\\r\\ngained at every stride on poor, tired Jack.They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when he hurled the stone, a\\r\\njagged flint, which he held in his hand. This caught Jack on the knee,\\r\\nand caused him to cry out in agony and come to a sudden stop, when the\\r\\nthree men threw themselves upon their victim, pommelling and dragging at\\r\\nhim as though they would tear every shred of clothes off his body.However, Jack was not yet conquered, and he fought and tore, kicking,\\r\\nscratching, and biting like a mad thing, yelling loudly for help, and\\r\\ndefying the efforts of the men to snatch from him his watch—his\\r\\nfather’s last present to him—or to tear from his pocket his little\\r\\nstock of money.Such a struggle, however, could not last long, and presently the man\\r\\nwith the bludgeon wrenched away Jack’s watch and chain. He then stood\\r\\nby, waiting for an opportunity to give the lad a blow that should keep\\r\\nhim quiet while the others rifled his pockets, when all of a sudden he\\r\\ncried out, ‘Ware, boys! there’s somebody comin’!’The others paused in their work, and Jack gave another yell at the top\\r\\nof his lungs, when the tramp{13}ling of a horse sounded in his ears and an\\r\\nangry voice cried out, ‘Now, you scum, what’s this?’ Then Red-Head, who\\r\\nhad Jack by the throat, was lifted bodily up by his scruff and his\\r\\nragged trousers, and hurled violently into the ditch beside the road.Half-dazed, Jack glanced up to see in front of him a soldier facing the\\r\\nremaining roughs. These seemed half-inclined to show fight; but the\\r\\nsoldier struck out with one gauntleted fist, and he who had thrown the\\r\\nstone at Jack joined his companion in the ditch. For a moment they lay\\r\\nthere, then crawled out; upon which the soldier, running up to them,\\r\\napplied the toe of his boot to their coat-tails in a most determined\\r\\nmanner, crying out at the same time, ‘Cut it, you rogues—cut it, or it\\r\\nwill be the worse for you.’And cut it they did, breaking through the bushes and disappearing quite\\r\\nas quickly as they had appeared.Jack was so busy watching the punishment the two rogues were receiving\\r\\nthat he did not notice him with the bludgeon sneaking away. When he\\r\\nturned, the fellow was just making off across the field behind them\\r\\ntowards some old barns standing amongst the trees. Jack remembered his\\r\\nwatch.‘Oh sir, please!’ he cried to the soldier, ‘that fellow is going off\\r\\nwith my watch, the last gift of my dead father!’‘Follow me,’ said the soldier curtly, and he swung himself on to his\\r\\nhorse, which during the struggle had stood quietly by on the very spot\\r\\nwhere his master had dismounted.The soldier put his horse at the hedge, which he took at a leap, and\\r\\nJack forced his way through the same gap that the tramp had. This fellow\\r\\ncould be seen scurrying away across the field; but the soldier,{14}\\r\\ntouching his horse with his spurs, soon passed him. Then wheeling round\\r\\nhis horse so as to get the man between himself and Jack, he cried out,\\r\\n‘Stop, you rogue, and give up that watch, or I’ll leather your hide for\\r\\nyou.’The fellow turned round with a snarl; then raising his bludgeon he\\r\\nhurled it with all his might at the soldier’s horse, evidently in the\\r\\nhope of making it rear and throw its rider.The stick caught the horse on the side of its head and did make it rear\\r\\nin a way that would have unseated a less skilful rider than the soldier;\\r\\nbut he kept his seat with ease. Then, whipping his glittering sword from\\r\\nits scabbard, in three bounds he placed his horse beside the tramp.‘You scum! you jail-bird!’ he cried in angry tones, ‘I’ve a good mind to\\r\\ncut you down or trample you under my horse’s hoofs.’‘Yes, sir—yes, sir; there it is,’ and the man produced it from a\\r\\ncapacious pocket, Jack running forward and taking it from him.‘Now, cut it!’ cried the soldier; and as the man turned to obey he gave\\r\\nhim half-a-dozen across the head and shoulders with the flat of his\\r\\nsword, laying on so lustily that the rogue howled again with pain.‘Now, lad, let’s get back,’ said the soldier kindly to Jack; and they\\r\\nreturned to the place where the scuffle had taken place and where Jack’s\\r\\nportmanteau still lay.The other two men had completely disappeared,{15} which the soldier said\\r\\nwas a good thing, for it was a tedious job giving people into custody,\\r\\nand, besides, he had no time to go dancing attendance at police-courts.‘A good horse-whipping in many cases would do more good than three\\r\\nmonths’ hard,’ he said, ‘and it’s less trouble.’He then dismounted to examine his horse’s head and see whether it had\\r\\nbeen hurt at all by the tramp’s bludgeon, and as he did so Jack took the\\r\\nopportunity of closely examining him.The soldier was a tall, fine, handsome-looking man, clad in\\r\\nwhite-striped blue overalls, and a dark-blue jacket with white cuffs and\\r\\nfacings, on the arms of which several gold stripes betokened the wearer\\r\\nto be a non-commissioned officer. Worn on the stripes was a silver badge\\r\\nwhich attracted Jack’s attention. It was a grinning death’s-head\\r\\nstanding above two crossed shin-bones.The soldier wore a head-dress with a white square top, from the left\\r\\nside of which drooped a black plume, while on the plate in front the\\r\\nsame grisly death’s-head and cross-bones seemed to grin at the beholder.\\r\\nJingling spurs, a long sword trailing on the ground, and white leather\\r\\ngauntlets completed the soldier’s attire.Satisfying himself that his horse, a fine-looking black, was not hurt,\\r\\nthe soldier turned to Jack, and with a cheery smile said, ‘Well, my lad,\\r\\nit seems to me I arrived on the scene just in the nick of time.’‘Indeed it was everything. Had you not arrived I{16} should have lost my\\r\\nall; perhaps my life too, though, God knows, that would not have\\r\\ntroubled me much were it not for my poor mother.’The soldier gave the boy a keen, penetrating glance. ‘You speak\\r\\ndespondingly for one so young,’ he said. ‘You seem down on your luck;\\r\\nbut cheer up, the longest lane must have a turning. How was it those\\r\\nrogues came to attack you?’In rather broken sentences Jack began to tell his tale. But the late\\r\\nexcitement he had passed through, coming on the top of great bodily\\r\\nfatigue, proved too much for him, and in a minute he found himself\\r\\nrambling in his speech; then the soldier seemed to be far, far away, and\\r\\nJack fell back in a dead faint.When he again opened his eyes he was lying on the grass under the shadow\\r\\nof some big trees. His head and neck felt deliciously cool, and putting\\r\\nup his hand he found they were running with water. The soldier, having\\r\\ndivested himself of his gauntlets and gay plumed head-dress, was chafing\\r\\nJack’s hands, while a pleasing feeling of drowsiness pervaded him.‘Come, young fellow,’ said the soldier, it seemed to Jack rather\\r\\nanxiously, ‘you’ve had a long turn. I began to think you were a case for\\r\\nthe doctor’s hands.’‘Oh I’m all right,’ said Jack doggedly, and tried to struggle to his\\r\\nfeet; but the soldier gently restrained him.‘Wait a bit, sonny,’ he said; ‘just rest and pull yourself together.\\r\\nYou’ve had a nasty shock. But if you’ll remain quietly here for ten\\r\\nminutes or so, there’s an inn near by where I can get you a mouthful of\\r\\nbrandy.’‘Don’t you trouble; I’m all right,’ said Jack; and again he struggled to\\r\\nhis feet. But his knee pained{17} him so badly, his feet were so sore, and\\r\\nhe felt so weak, that with a moan he sank back again upon the grass.The kindly soldier adjusted the little portmanteau under his head and\\r\\nagain sprinkled his head and neck with cold water from the brook. Then\\r\\nsaying, ‘Now, lie quietly here till I come back,’ strode off; Jack, in a\\r\\nsemi-conscious state, watching the tall, soldierly figure disappear in\\r\\nthe distance.{18}‘I wanted to get to London,’ replied Jack. ‘But I am afraid that after\\r\\nmy late shake up I sha’n’t be able to get as far to-night.’‘The fact is, I’m down on my luck. I’m out of a situation, with very\\r\\nlittle chance of getting another.’ And then Jack told his story, down to\\r\\nthe time when the tramps attacked him.The soldier listened attentively. ‘That’s just a very lonely bit of road\\r\\nthere,’ he said, ‘especially about this time on a Sunday. It was by the\\r\\nmerest chance that I happened to pass and hear your cries. I was just\\r\\nreturning from the house of one of my officers, to whom I had taken a\\r\\nletter.’The soldier smiled. ‘I thought our uniform and badge were pretty well\\r\\nknown,’ he said. ‘My regi{19}ment is the 17th Lancers, the “Death or Glory\\r\\nBoys.” But I must be getting on, though I don’t like to leave you here.\\r\\nI’ll see you as far as Hounslow if you like, and I should advise you to\\r\\nput up there for the night and make an early start for London in the\\r\\nmorning.’This seemed to Jack good advice, though he thought with a sinking heart\\r\\nof his small stock of money, which would be thus further reduced. He got\\r\\non to his feet, and was then astonished to find how weak and giddy he\\r\\nfelt.He placed his left arm round Jack’s waist, half-supporting him; took the\\r\\nportmanteau in his other hand, and, whistling to his horse, which at\\r\\nonce followed him, he led the way out of the pleasant meadow on to the\\r\\nhighroad. He then gave Jack a ‘leg up’ into the saddle, and instructed\\r\\nhim to hold his slender portmanteau in front of him; then, with his\\r\\nright hand on the horse’s bridle, and carrying his sabre in his left,\\r\\naway they went.Before they reached the barracks the sergeant dismounted Jack and they\\r\\nboth passed in on foot. Jack gave an admiring glance at the smart young\\r\\nsoldier, in all his gay trappings, a ten-foot lance surmounted by red\\r\\nand white bannerols in his hand, his spurred heels jingling on the\\r\\nstones as he strode up and down in front of the guard-room, outside\\r\\nwhich several soldiers, all also in full-dress, were standing or\\r\\nsitting.Sergeant Barrymore’s quarters were reached. The sergeant’s wife, who was\\r\\nquite a superior woman, was soon in possession of the facts of the case.\\r\\nWith a{20} woman’s quick instinct she saw that the youth before her was\\r\\ntired and faint and hungry.He was at once taken in; water, with soap and towels, placed for him;\\r\\nand then, when a welcome wash had refreshed him, a pot of coffee with\\r\\nsome grilled ham-and-eggs and sweet white bread were waiting for him.\\r\\nJack ate heartily and soon felt much better.By that time the sergeant had divested himself of his gay trappings, and\\r\\nwas in a loose undress jacket, slippers on his feet, and a well-used\\r\\nbriar-pipe in his mouth. Jack turned to his host and hostess with the\\r\\nsuspicion of a tear in his eye.‘How can I thank you both for your more than kindness?’ he said. ‘You\\r\\nare indeed good Samaritans, and I can never hope to repay you for what\\r\\nyou have done.’‘But I’m not a comrade,’ said Jack with a smile. ‘I’m just a waster, a\\r\\nfailure,’ he added with some bitterness.‘Tut, tut, all men are comrades; but no more talking. A night’s sleep is\\r\\nwhat you want. Come with me. We can give you a shakedown, nothing more;\\r\\nbut I dare say you’ll sleep well enough, and to-morrow you can get on\\r\\nyour way again.’The sergeant got a basin of hot water, in which Jack bathed his poor,\\r\\ngalled feet. Some ointment was applied to them, a rag soaked in liniment\\r\\ntied round his injured knee, and Jack was ready for bed. A couple of\\r\\nregimental blankets on the sofa in Sergeant Barrymore’s sitting-room\\r\\nmade a comfortable bed, and thus Jack passed his first night with{21} those\\r\\nwho, though he did not know it, for years to come, on land and sea, in\\r\\ncomfortable home-quarters or on the blood-stained battlefields of the\\r\\nCrimea, were to be his loyal and gallant comrades.His long and dreamless slumbers were at last broken by a ringing peal of\\r\\nmartial music, and he awoke with a start to wonder where he was and what\\r\\nwere the sounds he heard. The music, which he knew to be a trumpet-call,\\r\\nceased; then he heard a variety of sounds, sharp commands given in that\\r\\ntone of voice peculiar to the cavalry service, the trampling of horses’\\r\\nhoofs on the ground, and the jingling of bits and steel scabbards\\r\\nagainst stirrups.Jack jumped up, hurried on his clothes, and went to the window. The\\r\\nsight that met his gaze drew an involuntary exclamation of delight from\\r\\nhim. There, on the parade-ground just below him, he saw, drawn up in\\r\\ncolumn of troops, the gallant ‘Death or Glory Boys.’It was a magnificent morning, the bright sun shining on the burnished\\r\\nsword-scabbards and lance-points, making them flash and glisten like\\r\\nmyriads of diamonds, while the light breeze was just enough to flutter\\r\\nthe drooping black plumes and the gay red and white lance-pennons. The\\r\\nfacings of the dark-blue uniforms looked snowy white, the shape of the\\r\\nmen’s legs being shown to perfection by the white-striped overalls. The\\r\\nhorses tossed their heads proudly and pawed the ground restively as\\r\\nthough impatient to be off outside the gates, where they seemed to know\\r\\na crowd had gathered to see the gallant regiment march off.As Jack looked, the trumpeters sounded the ‘General Parade,’ and the\\r\\nofficers took up their posi{22}tion with the regiment, the gold lace\\r\\nglittering on their uniforms and horse-furniture, conspicuous on which\\r\\nwas the grinning skull and cross-bones, their great plumes of black\\r\\nswans’ feathers rustling in the breeze.Then a handsome, distinguished-looking man, on whose breast glittered\\r\\nseveral medals and orders, rode up. A few curt commands followed, the\\r\\nlances came up to the ‘carry,’ and the officers drew their swords.The band, which had been sitting mounted just on the right of the\\r\\nregiment, struck up a lively march and moved off; the regiment, in\\r\\nsections, followed, and the ‘Death or Glory Boys’ passed in review\\r\\nbefore Jack.‘What a glorious sight! how noble they look!’ cried Jack aloud. ‘How I\\r\\nshould love to ride in their ranks!’‘Would you, indeed, sonny?’ said a voice behind him, and, turning, Jack\\r\\nbeheld Sergeant Barrymore, a kindly smile on his sunburnt features,\\r\\nregarding him with a quizzical smile.{23}‘I think I should,’ replied Jack with a blush; ‘the men did look so\\r\\ngrand. I’ve never seen a Lancer regiment before.’‘It’s not all beer and skittles in the army,’ said the sergeant; ‘but a\\r\\nlad of mettle might do worse. You know what the song says,’ and the\\r\\nsergeant sang in a bass voice:The regiment, Jack heard, was going to London to form a guard of honour\\r\\nand escort to the Queen on some state function.After breakfast he and Jack had a long talk, and it was quite clear that\\r\\nthe sergeant was heart and soul in his profession, and thought there was\\r\\nno other to equal it.Jack had a great dread of being a drag and an expense to his mother. He\\r\\nfelt certain that Mr Phogg would give him a reference that would spoil\\r\\nhis{24} chance of getting employment—at least anything better than an\\r\\nerrand boy’s or a porter’s place. A hundred times rather than that he\\r\\nwould be a soldier; that was, at any rate, an honourable profession.During the day he wandered about the barracks and had a good look at the\\r\\nguard, particularly admiring the trumpeter, a boy of about his own age,\\r\\nwho from time to time, arrayed in his gay Lancer uniform, came forth and\\r\\nsounded different calls.When the regiment returned at night he heard the men laughing and joking\\r\\nand relating much that had passed on the march up to London and during\\r\\ntheir progress through the crowded Metropolis; of the princes, lords,\\r\\nand other celebrated people they had seen; and, lastly, how well her\\r\\nMajesty and the Prince Consort looked.As he again turned in on the sergeant’s sofa his mind was made up. He\\r\\nwould be a soldier, and his regiment should be the gallant ‘Death or\\r\\nGlory Boys.’Together they crossed the barrack square, passing on their way the young\\r\\ntrumpeter whom Jack had so much admired.They went on to a room near the band-quarters, where they found a rather\\r\\nstout, shortish man, busy at a table copying out music.‘Ah, that’s good; I want a real smart lad in the trumpets, one who will\\r\\ntake an interest in his work and take up second cornet in the band.’Jack, thus brought into prominence, coloured up as he stood in the\\r\\npresence of the two non-commissioned officers, for Ted Joyce was the\\r\\ntrumpet-major.‘Sir no one here but the officers,’ said the trumpet-major, who was a\\r\\npleasant, rather fussy little man. ‘Know anything about music?’ he\\r\\nasked.‘No pianos in the band,’ said the trumpet-major with a smile; ‘but if\\r\\nyou can read well that’s something. You can’t beat time or rhythm into\\r\\nsome of my trumpeters. Your lips look all right too; if you can use your\\r\\ntongue well I can make a good trumpeter of you.’Jack had not the faintest notion of what the trumpet-major meant. The\\r\\nlatter picked up a trumpet lying on a chair, and handing it to Jack\\r\\nsaid, ‘Now, put your lips together and try and sound that.’‘Squeeze your lips and make an action with your tongue as though you\\r\\nwere trying to spit a bit of cotton-wool off it into the mouthpiece,’\\r\\nsaid the trumpet-major.{26}Jack, with a smile, did as he was bidden, and at the third or fourth\\r\\nattempt succeeded in making a most unearthly sound.‘Capital, capital!’ said the trumpet-major, rubbing his hands; ‘in three\\r\\nmonths we shall have you sounding on the square.’‘Come along over to the Orderly Room,’ said the trumpet-major; ‘we shall\\r\\nfind the regimental there.’The three departed, and in the Orderly Room, beside the clerks, Jack saw\\r\\nthe regimental sergeant-major, the man who, though not a commissioned\\r\\nofficer, after the colonel and adjutant is the most important personage\\r\\nin a cavalry regiment. The regimental was one of the few men in the\\r\\nregiment who wore a decoration, besides which he was a fine,\\r\\nsoldierly-looking fellow, with a pair of whiskers that were the envy of\\r\\nall the subalterns in the corps.The trumpet-major promptly stated his business, and the regimental\\r\\nproduced an attestation paper{27} which one of the clerks filled up as Jack\\r\\nanswered the questions. Then he was put under the standard.‘Five feet six full; put him down five six and a quarter,’ called out\\r\\nthe regimental, as he adjusted the standard above Jack’s head; ‘chest\\r\\nthirty-five,’ he went on, ‘complexion fair, hair brown, eyes hazel.’\\r\\nThen to Jack, ‘Open your mouth,’ and concluded, ‘Teeth sound.’‘You can get him before the doctor this morning, Joyce,’ said the\\r\\nregimental, ‘and then we’ll swear him in. You’ve got a fine lad there.’‘Now, Jack,’ said Barrymore as they crossed the square, ‘you’ll soon be\\r\\nas much a soldier as I am. The trumpet-major will take charge of you for\\r\\nthe present, and when you’ve been before the doctor come over to my\\r\\nquarters.’Jack accompanied the trumpet-major to his room, and later on was taken\\r\\nbefore the doctor, where he was thoroughly examined and pronounced fit\\r\\nto serve her Majesty.‘You’re now due to a day’s pay,’ said the trumpet-major. ‘By the way,\\r\\nhow are you off for money—do you want any?’‘Then stick to them. And just take a word of advice on the first day of\\r\\nyour service. Be smart, scrupulously clean, and remember ours is a\\r\\nhandsome uniform and wants keeping clean; be obedient—obedience is the\\r\\nfirst duty of a soldier; and don’t try and ape the manners of the men.\\r\\nDon’t forget you are still a boy; keep away from smoking; above all,\\r\\nkeep away from drink, and don’t let the example of any of your comrades,\\r\\nespecially of those who ought{28} to know better, lead you into ways that\\r\\nare bound, sooner or later, to end badly for you.’These words of the trumpet-major occurred to Jack’s mind on many a\\r\\nfuture day, and it was by acting up to them to the best of his ability\\r\\nthat he owed much of his later success. He passed another night on the\\r\\nkindly sergeant’s sofa, then next morning was taken before the local\\r\\nmagistrate to be sworn in. On his return to barracks Jack was handed\\r\\nover to the trumpet-major, who was just returning from practice.‘Now, Blair,’ he said, ‘you’re a soldier. From this very minute your\\r\\ntraining begins. We’ll go over to the Orderly Room, see the regimental,\\r\\nand then you’d better make the acquaintance of your future comrades.’In the Orderly Room a regimental number was given Jack, details of his\\r\\npay, &c., explained, and then he was marched over to the regimental\\r\\ntailor’s, where he was measured for his uniform. These items being\\r\\nsettled, he returned to the trumpet-major’s quarters, where he found the\\r\\nyouth whom Sergeant Barrymore had called Will, now clad in the neat blue\\r\\nand white undress of the regiment, talking to the trumpet-major.‘Ha, here you are,’ said Joyce. ‘Good.—Now, Hodson, I shall give him\\r\\ninto your charge. There’s a spare bed in your room, isn’t there?’‘Right; then Blair can have it. I’ll see Sergeant Linham later and get\\r\\nhim entered in mess. Now take him over and make him known to the boys.’Trumpeter Hodson, who had a merry, mischievous eye, looked at Jack as\\r\\nthey went off; then said abruptly, ‘What’s your name?{29}’Will Hodson shrugged his shoulders. ‘I’d rather be a swell on five\\r\\nthousand pounds a year,’ he said; ‘but every one must do something.\\r\\nWe’re soldiers. The governor put in twenty-five years, grandfather was\\r\\nkilled at Waterloo, and I dare say some of my forebears were banging a\\r\\ndrum or handling a pike at’—— and he paused for a word.‘Ah, that’s it,’ said Will Hodson quite calmly; ‘the name slipped my\\r\\nmemory for a moment. But, I say, you’re a cut above the usual ruck, you\\r\\nknow; you won’t find it all honey here, I can tell you.’‘I hope you can. Well, here we are,’ and Hodson opened a door which\\r\\nstood at the head of a flight of stone steps they had just ascended.‘Chums,’ he cried, ‘an illustrious arrival has come amongst us. Allow me\\r\\nto introduce to you John Blair, askewer, taterpeeler to his Highness the\\r\\nKing of the Cannibal Islands.’Jack paused on the threshold of the door and gazed with interest for the\\r\\nfirst time at a barrack-room.{30}The occupants of the room were variously engaged. Two young fellows at\\r\\none end of the room were engaged in a bout with the boxing-gloves;\\r\\nanother was sitting at the table writing a letter; a fourth was engaged\\r\\nburnishing a sword-scabbard, other parts of his kit lying round him; a\\r\\nfifth lad was pipeclaying a pair of gauntlets; while seated at a window,\\r\\ndressed in shirt and overalls only, was the eldest of the party, a\\r\\nshort, stout young man, smoking a clay-pipe and talking to a comrade.Over the beds hung each man’s sword and belts, and on a shelf above\\r\\nthese were the lance-caps in their oilskin cases, and the clothes neatly\\r\\nfolded, surmounting the sheepskin and the blue shabracks which covered\\r\\nthe saddles when the regiment was in review order.Jack was not long taking in these details; but before he had done so the\\r\\nvarious occupants of the room had desisted from their occupations and\\r\\nfixed their eyes upon him.‘Why, it’s Sergeant Barrymore’s pup!’ said the{31} young fellow with the\\r\\npipe. ‘Come here, kid, and let’s have a look at you.’‘Ho my!’ exclaimed he with the pipe. ‘Well, just behave yourself, or\\r\\nyou’ll feel the weight of my boot.’He took Jack to a bed which he said would be his, and proceeded to show\\r\\nhim how to put down and make it with the straw-filled tick and the\\r\\ncoarse sheets and blankets. Jack helped to roll and strap it up again\\r\\njust as a trumpet sounded outside.‘There goes mess,’ cried Bandsman Napper. ‘Now, Brown, shin off and get\\r\\nthe grub;’ and a young trumpeter, picking up a big tin, left the room.The table required little laying, the boys producing from the shelves\\r\\nover their beds chunks of bread, in which knives and forks were stuck,\\r\\nplates and basins like pudding-basins were laid on the table, and the\\r\\nbandsman who had been talking to Napper, with a jaunty ‘Ta-ta, boys!’\\r\\nwent off to his own room.The trumpeter who had departed for the dinners presently returned, and\\r\\nin the mess-tin was a great piece of meat and a number of baked potatoes\\r\\nswimming in the fat beneath; and a second youngster followed with a\\r\\ngreat tin of cabbage. All these were placed on the table.The plates were passed up, and Napper, who was{32} in charge of the room,\\r\\ncommenced to carve the meat. Carving, with him, simply consisted of\\r\\nfirst trimming off the brown, well-done portions and some crisp fat for\\r\\nhimself, then cutting the remainder into seven ugly chunks, one of which\\r\\nhe dumped on each plate. Hodson added some potatoes, and each helped\\r\\nhimself to cabbage; then without any more ado all fell to.Hodson, looking up, saw Jack had nothing on the plate in front of him.\\r\\n‘I say, Napper,’ he said, ‘Blair’s got no grub.’‘He ain’t had any rations drawn for him, anyhow. If he wants any grub\\r\\nlet him get it in the sergeants’ mess with his pals,’ he concluded\\r\\nspitefully, evidently alluding to Jack’s friendliness with Barrymore.‘Never mind, chummy; share with me,’ said Hodson, proceeding to put some\\r\\nof his dinner on Jack’s plate.‘Certainly not,’ replied Jack. ‘I’m not very hungry, and in any case Mr\\r\\nNapper says I can have the bone. I’ll take him at his word, for I’m\\r\\nparticularly fond of picking a bone.’The ‘Mr’ tickled the fancy of the youngsters, one or two of whom grinned\\r\\ngleefully, perceiving which, Napper scowled round upon them.‘Look here, you young tramp,’ he said savagely to Jack, ‘don’t you give\\r\\nme any of your cheek or I’ll cuff your head for you. And you can take\\r\\noff those{33} elegant manners too. If your “superior education” fits you\\r\\nfor the orficers’ mess you’d better get there; they want waiters anyway.\\r\\nBut while you’re here you’ll knock under, d’ye hear?’Hodson had put the bone on Jack’s plate, and was adding some potatoes\\r\\nwhen Napper cried out, ‘Drop those; we don’t mind giving dogs bones, but\\r\\nwe don’t give ’em spuds.’At this the laugh turned against Jack; but at boarding-school he had\\r\\nbeen too used to that to take any notice. So with some cabbage, which\\r\\nHodson, in defiance of his superior, gave him, and with a lump of bread\\r\\nwhich another trumpeter offered him, he made a very good dinner, for\\r\\nthere was plenty of meat on the bone.Napper was in a bad humour, and after he had finished his dinner,\\r\\nlighting up his pipe, he said to Jack, ‘You’ll just understand that I’m\\r\\nin charge here and you’ll do as you’re told.’Jack made no reply, for he saw at once that Napper was a bully, misusing\\r\\nthe little authority he had, and that the majority of the trumpeters\\r\\nfound it paid them to toady a little to one much older and stronger than\\r\\nthemselves. On his part Jack determined to feel his feet before he\\r\\ntackled Bandsman Napper, for he felt assured before long they would come\\r\\nto grips.Seeing Jack stood without speaking, Napper said, ‘You’ll help Brown to\\r\\nwash up and tidy the room.{34} You’ve got to work here, and the sooner you\\r\\nbegin the better.’Jack helped to wash up the plates, knives, and forks, the hot water\\r\\nbeing got from the cook-house. Then the table was washed down and the\\r\\nfloor swept.By that time all the trumpeters, except one who was cleaning up his kit\\r\\nfor guard the next day, had gone off to practice. Jack looked across at\\r\\nhim, and saw he was busy burnishing a pair of spurs. This trumpeter,\\r\\nwhose name was Parkes, was a stolid-looking lad, who took no notice of\\r\\nJack till the latter went up to him and in a cheery voice said, ‘I say,\\r\\ncan I help you?’‘I don’t want to borrow anything. Sooner or later I’ve got to learn to\\r\\ndo what you’re doing. I hate doing nothing. Show me how, and I’ll help\\r\\nyou.’‘Now you’re talking!’ said Parkes. ‘You’re the man I want to meet every\\r\\ntime I’m for guard. Can you black boots?’‘Clean them, then,’ and he pointed to his Wellingtons. ‘You’ll find the\\r\\nblacking and brushes in my valise.’He showed Jack how to polish the plate on the front of his lance-cap,\\r\\nand the chin-chain, and when he had done this Jack could not resist the\\r\\ntemptation of putting the cap on and surveying himself in the bit{35} of\\r\\nlooking-glass, four inches square, fastened on the wall at the head of\\r\\nParkes’ bed.‘Wait till you’ve worn one six hours at a stretch on a broiling-hot day,\\r\\nthen tell me how you like it,’ grinned Parkes.The whole of his accoutrements being cleaned, that youth jerked out a\\r\\nbrief ‘Thanks!’ then put down his bed, and throwing himself on it\\r\\ncomposed himself for a nap. Before he sank quite into the land of dreams\\r\\nhe suddenly started up and said, ‘Didn’t I hear your name was Blair?’‘Same man. Name’s Sam Napper; S. Napper—see? We call him Snapper; you\\r\\ncan guess why. Give him a wide berth, and don’t try hitting back at him\\r\\nunless you’re sure of getting your blow in, else, as sure as I’m Billy\\r\\nParkes, you’ll curse the day you ever made the Queen’s bad bargain.’Almost before this speech, a very long one for Parkes, was finished,\\r\\nthat gentleman was asleep; and making a shrewd guess that by ‘the\\r\\nQueen’s bad bargain’ Parkes meant enlisting, Jack sat quietly down and\\r\\nthought over the situation.That Napper was a bully he had already seen; that he was of a low\\r\\ndisposition he guessed, and that he set the young trumpeters a bad\\r\\nexample he feared. It was clear there would be trouble between them; he\\r\\nwas not going to sit down under tyranny. He would{36} do his duty\\r\\ncheerfully and manfully, and try to please Napper; if things went\\r\\nwrong—well, they would see.This being settled, Jack thought it a good opportunity to write to his\\r\\nmother an account of all that had happened, and explain to her how it\\r\\nwas he had become a trumpeter in the ‘Death or Glory Boys.’ He procured\\r\\nsome note-paper from the canteen, and then set to work to write a long\\r\\nletter. He was just finishing, when, with a clatter and a jingle,\\r\\nlaughing and talking, the rest of the trumpeters, headed by Napper, came\\r\\ntrooping into the room. Hodson went up to Jack.Napper interrupted. ‘Can’t you see he’s writing to his\\r\\nmammy.—Requesting the old girl to send you a bob’s worth of stamps,\\r\\neh?’ he asked of Jack.‘Ho, ho, the dook’s on his high horse,’ said Napper; ‘been telling “my\\r\\nmamma” I’ve joined the cavalry, don’t-cher-know, and shall soon be in\\r\\nthe orficers’ mess.’‘Let’s see what the young beggar has said,’ cried Napper, stepping up to\\r\\nJack and trying to snatch his letter.‘Don’t you interfere with me or try to touch my letter,’ he cried, his\\r\\nvoice vibrating with passion.Napper tried to seize the hand in which Jack held his letter; but the\\r\\nlatter placed his left hand on Napper’s chest and pushed him so\\r\\nviolently that he almost fell backwards.{37}Napper turned livid with rage. ‘You scum, you,’ he cried, ‘I’ll show\\r\\nyou. I’ve had to take cocky youngsters down before. Here, one of you,\\r\\ngive me my whip!’No one moved, though several of the youngsters looked nervously at one\\r\\nanother. Napper sprang to his bed, snatched down his riding-whip, and\\r\\nadvancing towards Jack, cried, ‘Give me that letter or I’ll tan you till\\r\\nyou can’t stand.’Napper raised the whip, and Jack put up his arm to ward off the blow;\\r\\nbut at that moment the door was opened, a jingle of spurs sounded, and a\\r\\nhoarse voice cried, ‘Ha, hum! now, you toads, what is all this? Not a\\r\\nmove, any one, or I’ll put the lot under arrest. What d’ye mean by it I\\r\\nwant to know? D’ye hear, I want to know?{38}’This man was dressed in the neat undress of the regiment, and the\\r\\nstripes on his arms and the gold trumpets proclaimed him to be a\\r\\nsergeant-trumpeter. He was thin, and a little knock-kneed, like one who\\r\\nhas lived much in the saddle, which indeed he had. On his breast were\\r\\ntwo ribbons, showing he was one of the few proud possessors of war\\r\\nhonours in the regiment. His face was like leather, both in colour and\\r\\nsubstance; he had a heavy black moustache, great, black bushy eyebrows,\\r\\nwhich stuck out from under his forage-cap, an enormous beak-like nose,\\r\\nand two little, beady black eyes, which gave him an eagle-like\\r\\nappearance. His uniform was spotless, stripes, facings, and gloves being\\r\\nsnowy white, while his buttons quite glistened.On entering the room he clicked his spurred heels together—one knee as\\r\\nhe stood thus slightly overlapping the other—drew himself up to his\\r\\nfull height, threw back his head, and glared angrily around.Getting no answer to his question, Sergeant Linham inquired again in\\r\\nportentous tones, ‘Ha, hum! answer me at once; I want to know.’‘It’s all right, sergeant,’ said Napper suavely,{39} deftly throwing his\\r\\nwhip behind him on to one of the beds, ‘I was just giving this new\\r\\nyoungster a word of advice; he’s inclined to be cheeky.’‘Bandsman Napper,’ said the sergeant, relaxing the tension of his\\r\\nmuscles a little, ‘you’re not to give advice with your whip, ha, hum!’\\r\\nand he cleared his throat, which he did regularly every few seconds\\r\\nwhile talking. ‘The Queen’s Regulations expressly forbid it; and\\r\\nremember that, all you toads.’This was a favourite word with Sergeant Linham, every one who offended\\r\\nhim in the least being a toad.Every one was perfectly quiet, and Linham continued, ‘Bandsman Napper,\\r\\nJohn Blair, recruit, is placed in your mess. Trumpeter Hodson will take\\r\\nhim in hand for a few weeks, and you’ll give him any information in your\\r\\npower. He will go to the trumpet-major’s quarters at six o’clock this\\r\\nevening and get his trumpet, bugle, and cords. He will attend\\r\\ntrumpet-practice in the morning, ha, hum!’ And wheeling round, Sergeant\\r\\nLinham disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared.‘Silly fool,’ said Napper; ‘he’s like an old woman. Now then,’ as a\\r\\ntrumpet rang out, ‘there’s mess; away for the tea.’Several voices answered, ‘Yes, I want some butter;{40}’ ‘Bring us a\\r\\nha’p’orth of jam,’ and such like, and such like.‘Any one lend me a brown and I’ll treat myself to a bloater,’ said\\r\\nHodson; but no answer being forthcoming, with a cheery whistle he\\r\\nturned, noticed Parkes on his bed, who continued to snore loudly, gave\\r\\nhim a sounding smack on the tightest part of his overalls, and cried\\r\\nout, ‘Wake up, you lazy pig, and shut that row.’‘Dawes,’ whispered Hodson, pointing to the red-headed, blubber-lipped\\r\\ntrumpeter, who was standing with his back to Parkes.The latter youth, with an angry cry, charged the supposed culprit, and\\r\\nin a second they were trying to tear one another’s head off, while\\r\\nHodson was looking out of the window.Jack went off with Brown to the cook-house to get the tea, and on their\\r\\nway they called in at the canteen, where Jack got a stamp, and took the\\r\\nopportunity of posting his letter. He then helped Brown to get the\\r\\nthings wanted, and bought a bloater, already cooked of course, which he\\r\\ntook back for Hodson.‘Mind? Why, I’d accept anything from anybody. Blair, you’re a trump;\\r\\nyou’ve got sense. You and me are going to be friends,’ he concluded with\\r\\na total disregard of grammar, most of the trumpeters knowing far more\\r\\nabout the Queen’s Regulations than about the Queen’s English.{41}At the time fixed he went to the trumpet-major’s quarters, received his\\r\\ntrumpet and bugle, together with a few instructions about the morrow,\\r\\nand then returned to his room.With the exception of Napper, the trumpeters had to be in barracks\\r\\nearly, all of them parading at nine o’clock to sound ‘First post,’ and\\r\\nagain at nine-thirty ‘Last post,’ after which they went to their\\r\\nquarters, lights being out at ten-fifteen.With Hodson’s help, Jack put down his bed, and, not caring to join in\\r\\nthe skylarking which was going on, about nine o’clock got quietly into\\r\\nbed.Some time before ten, Napper, looking very red in the face and walking a\\r\\ntrifle unsteadily, came in. He looked round crossly. ‘All in?’ he asked.‘Then chuck this fooling and turn in, or—hic—you’ll get something.’ He\\r\\nsat on his bed and took off his cap. ‘Callon, Callon, where are you?’ he\\r\\ncried.‘Come here. How many more times shall I tell you you’re to be here when\\r\\nI come in? Get off my boots.’Trumpeter Gallon came and knelt down by Napper, tugging at the studs\\r\\nwhich fastened the straps of his overalls down under his boots.Callon made an effort, undid the stud, and managed to tug off the\\r\\nWellington boot. He was engaged on the other, Napper holding out his\\r\\nleg, when the boy caught hold of the toe of the boot to pull it off.{42}With these words he kicked out his foot savagely, the spur catching\\r\\nCallon on the chin, which it badly pricked, and the heel striking him on\\r\\nthe mouth and cutting his lips.Callon uttered a cry and reeled backwards, on which one or two of the\\r\\ntrumpeters who had seen what had happened cried ‘Shame!’ and ‘Coward!’‘Here, draw it mild, Napper,’ said one of the older trumpeters, named\\r\\nBrittain; ‘you don’t want to kick a fellow’s teeth down his throat.’‘The little ass should mind what he’s doing then,’ muttered Napper\\r\\nrather shamefacedly, and he proceeded to pull off the boot himself and\\r\\nthen to get into bed.Callon, who slept in the next bed to Jack, undressed and got in, and\\r\\nJack fancied, after lights were out, he once or twice heard a sound like\\r\\na stifled sob come from the bed.He ground his teeth with rage at the sound, and he made a stern resolve.\\r\\nNapper should be stopped, either one way or another, and Jack crept\\r\\nquietly out of bed, and on bended knees prayed for strength and guidance\\r\\nwhen the decisive moment should arrive.{43}At breakfast-time Napper said nothing, but he looked exceedingly\\r\\ndisagreeable, as though his previous evening’s amusement had not agreed\\r\\nwith him.Jack noticed that Callon’s mouth was swollen and discoloured, while\\r\\nthere was a long, jagged scratch on his chin.The meal over, Sergeant Linham suddenly appeared, well shaven and\\r\\nfaultlessly dressed, as he always was.‘Ha, hum!’ he snorted—he had a way of blowing down his nose—‘Trumpeter\\r\\nBlair will parade at eight-thirty A.M. for recruits’ extension drill.’\\r\\nAnd he proceeded to detail other orders for the trumpeters.Hodson took Jack in hand, who polished up his old, well-worn boots,\\r\\nbrushed his clothes and cap, and then proceeded to the parade-ground,\\r\\nwhere he fell in on the extreme left of some four or five recruits who\\r\\nhad just joined. Under the instruction of a corporal he was soon busily\\r\\nengaged in extension motions, and after an hour of that there was not\\r\\none muscle in his body which did not ache. Still, his blood seemed to{44}\\r\\ncirculate more briskly, and he felt an unwonted lightness and\\r\\nelasticity.The extension-drill over, Jack was just in time to get his instruments\\r\\nand go off with the other trumpeters to the band-room for practice. The\\r\\ntrumpeters fell in in line, Sergeant Linham taking the practice.‘We’ll have a little practice in field-calls after trumpet practice,’ he\\r\\nsaid. ‘Captain Norreys complained to the trumpet-major that at the\\r\\nfield-day last Friday, when the colonel’s trumpeter sounded “Skirmishers\\r\\nout,” the trumpeter of the leading squadron sounded “Threes about.” Ha,\\r\\nhum! a disgraceful thing. If the officer I mentioned, one of the finest\\r\\nin the service, had not at once noticed it, such a thing might have led\\r\\nto the regiment getting mixed up and so have disgraced itself in the\\r\\neyes of the headquarter staff.’Who the guilty party was Jack did not know; but he heard a voice, a\\r\\nrather shamefaced one, say, ‘It was done in the excitement of the\\r\\nmoment, sergeant, and I noticed it directly I’d sounded. The calls are\\r\\nso much alike.’Sergeant Linham blew down his nose furiously. ‘Not a word—not a word.\\r\\nHow dare any trumpeter get excited, especially on such a paltry excuse\\r\\nas a field-day. By the Lord Harry, if the old 17th ever has to face an\\r\\nenemy in the field again, if it ever again hears the hum of bullets and\\r\\nsees the colour of a foeman’s eyes, what will happen to it? Now, I want\\r\\nto know!’On again getting no answer—for Sergeant Linham was a terrible martinet\\r\\non parade, and no one dared be familiar—the irascible sergeant, drawing\\r\\nhimself up and placing his stick beneath his arm, cried, ‘You can’t tell\\r\\nme. I knew you couldn’t. You’re too ignorant, so I’ll tell you. At the\\r\\nbattle of Chillianwallah, where I was attached to the 9th Lancers, a\\r\\ncertain English cavalry regiment—I won’t say which, for they afterwards\\r\\nwiped out their disgrace—this regiment was advancing to charge the\\r\\nenemy when some one sounded “Threes about,” whether by mistake or\\r\\nwilfully don’t matter. The regiment turned and galloped back, riding\\r\\nover infantry, breaking into guns, and Heaven knows what. My squadron of\\r\\nthe 9th cut in and saved the situation, or it might have led to the\\r\\ndefeat of the army. When the engagement was over the colonel of that\\r\\nregiment blew his brains out and the corps will be known as the “Threes\\r\\nabout,” as long as the service lasts. That’s the result of getting\\r\\nexcited and sounding wrong calls. Now, you toads, ‘shun!’Not a man or boy had moved while the sergeant had been speaking; but he\\r\\nglared round as though every one had been on the shuffle.‘You, Blair, fall back two paces,’ said the sergeant, ‘and keep your\\r\\nears open. Try and get the calls fixed in your memory.’The trumpeters then went through the different camp-calls on the\\r\\ntrumpet, and very pretty they sounded. Many of the short calls Jack, who\\r\\nhad a{46} very quick, musical ear, was able to remember; but the long ones,\\r\\nlike ‘Reveille,’ were too complicated.‘Stables,’ a very pretty call, Dawes (who had only joined a few months)\\r\\nhad great difficulty in sounding. He kept getting horribly flat on one\\r\\nnote, and ‘Hooky-beak,’ as the boys called Linham, grew crimson with\\r\\nrage.‘Squeeze it—squeeze it, you one-lunged bandicoot,’ cried the sergeant;\\r\\nand Dawes endeavoured to do so, but made a worse hash of it than before.‘Brittain, get out the cards,’ cried Linham; and from a cupboard\\r\\nBrittain got out some great cards about two feet wide and of different\\r\\nlengths, on which the various calls were printed in huge notes.‘Now, sound it, you blubber-lipped walrus, and if you don’t get the B\\r\\nflat this time I’ll put you back with the raw recruits!’Jack looked at the card hanging up and saw that the note the unfortunate\\r\\ntrumpeter could not sound was not B flat, but D, a very awkward note to\\r\\nproduce on the trumpet, and one which is used only in the ‘Stable’ call.The sergeant waved his stick, a curious-looking souvenir of his Indian\\r\\nservice. It was made of ebony or some other black wood, the end being\\r\\ncarved into the shape of an elephant’s head, having two long,{47} white\\r\\nivory tusks stuck in, which gave it a very realistic appearance.Jack had noticed that the sergeant, while the trumpeters had been\\r\\nsounding, had waved his ebony stick about in a most wonderful way, as\\r\\nthough beating time, but with motions that would have driven a\\r\\nbandmaster crazy and that would have puzzled any body of musicians.Before Dawes began to sound, the sergeant cried, ‘Now, keep in time.\\r\\nI’ll count;’ and he gave his stick a preliminary flourish like a trooper\\r\\nmaking ‘cut two’ with his sword, and causing Dawes to jump back, the\\r\\nferule of the stick having whizzed within a few inches of his nose.‘Stand still! How dare you move!’ yelled Linham. ‘Now,\\r\\n“Stables”—prepare to sound;’ and Dawes stood straight as a poker and\\r\\nbrought the mouthpiece of his trumpet to his mouth. ‘Sound!’Dawes made a fair start on the low C, the sergeant standing in front of\\r\\nhim, waving his stick frantically and counting aloud. His method of\\r\\ncounting was peculiar. He began, ‘One, two, three, four, five,’ and so\\r\\non, and proceeded up to about thirty-five, getting in anything from\\r\\nthree to five beats in a bar. As the call was in three-four time, Jack\\r\\nhad the greatest difficulty to keep from laughing; and when on the fatal\\r\\nD Dawes broke down, and Linham yelled, ‘Wrong, wrong, wrong! you’re\\r\\nsounding B flat again!’ he had to snigger.At this moment the trumpet-major entered the band-room; and, after\\r\\ntalking with the sergeant for a few moments, Linham was instructed to\\r\\ntake Jack, Dawes, and Brown to a small room off the band-room, and there\\r\\nto give them an hour’s scale practice, while{48} the trumpet-major\\r\\ninstructed the rest in some new harmonies which he had written for the\\r\\nlonger and more musical calls.Marching his three trumpeters away to the small room, Sergeant Linham\\r\\ngave them a long address, enlarging upon the stupidness of boys in\\r\\ngeneral and trumpeters in particular, giving some most fantastic\\r\\ninformation about the notation of the calls, which convinced Jack that\\r\\nno matter how good a trumpeter the sergeant might happen to be, he knew\\r\\nnothing whatever about music, sounding by ear; a fact which puzzled him\\r\\nmuch at the time, but which he afterwards found to be quite correct.The three boys had to sound the scale up and down on the trumpet, and\\r\\nJack, who had a good lip and was naturally quick at music, was able to\\r\\nperform fairly creditably, a fact which pleased Linham immensely.‘You show promise, decided promise,’ he said. ‘Listen carefully to what\\r\\nI tell you and I’ll make a trumpeter of you—ay, and a musician too, ha,\\r\\nhum!’Jack had his own opinion about that, and sounded the scale over and\\r\\nover. Every time he sounded a note untruly, let it be C, G, D, or\\r\\nanything else, the sergeant pulled him up with a ‘Ha, hum! flat, flat.\\r\\nSqueeze the lips; spit the tongue; you’re sounding B flat!’Before the practice was over Jack had mastered the ‘Band’ call and\\r\\n‘Markers’ sufficiently to be able to sound them, after a fashion. In\\r\\nthis he was of course much helped by hearing Dawes and Brown sound the\\r\\ncalls before him. Brown was rather stupid, and Dawes (who had thick\\r\\nlips) was ‘throaty’ and would certainly never make a first-class\\r\\ntrumpeter.{49}These two gentlemen very strongly resented being put back with Jack, and\\r\\nwhen the parade was dismissed they gave vent to their feelings in\\r\\nunmistakable terms.‘Oh, that’s nothing,’ said Will Hodson. ‘Jimmy’s a real treat; you’ll\\r\\nsee some fun with him before you’ve been with us long.’Jack was very well pleased with his morning’s work, and felt he should\\r\\nsoon master the trumpet and bugle, looking forward to the time when he\\r\\nshould be entitled to wear the cross-trumpets and be posted to a troop.\\r\\nThere was more practice that afternoon, followed by a visit to the\\r\\nregimental barber, who sheared off all Jack’s locks.The next day part of Jack’s uniform was finished, and for afternoon\\r\\ndrill, for the first time, with Will Hodson’s help, he donned the white\\r\\nstriped overalls, neat blue undress jacket, and the jaunty forage-cap.\\r\\nWellington boots and spurs, which to Jack’s ears jingled most martially,\\r\\ncompleted his attire; and as he took up his trumpet and bugle to fall in\\r\\nfor parade, Will Hodson declared that Jack looked a fair treat, and that\\r\\nthere wasn’t a smarter-looking trumpeter in the 17th.Bandsman Napper during this time let no opportunity slip of perpetrating\\r\\nlittle tyrannies on Jack, and showing him that he had not forgotten the\\r\\nepisode of the letter.Exactly a week had passed since Jack had entered{50} Hounslow Barracks with\\r\\nSergeant Barrymore, and on the Saturday afternoon he was crossing the\\r\\nsquare on his way from trumpet-practice when a trooper who had just come\\r\\nin cried out to him, ‘Isn’t your name Blair, sonny?’He hastened to the gate, and there, talking to the stalwart sentry, a\\r\\nhandkerchief and purse in one hand, a parasol in the other, stood his\\r\\nmother. Jack went up to her and held out his hand. ‘Mother!’ he cried.The old lady, in her black silk gown and widow’s neat bonnet, which did\\r\\nnot conceal her silvery hair parted in the centre and smoothed down on\\r\\neach side of her head, gave one look at the young soldier, on whose\\r\\nwell-knit, upright figure drill had already set its mark; then,\\r\\nrecognising Jack, she opened her arms, gave a sort of gasping cry, and\\r\\nfolded her son to her breast, saying, ‘John, John, my dearest son, to\\r\\nthink that I should ever see you thus in the garb of a common soldier!’Just at this moment Napper, on his way out to spend the evening, passed\\r\\nJack and his mother, and overhearing Mrs Blair’s remark, he made a\\r\\ngrimace at the sentry, saying in audible tones, ‘Poor mammy’s darling, I\\r\\nwonder whether she’s brought him a bit of sugar?’Jack flushed as he heard the remark, and drew his mother away from the\\r\\ngate. Where to take her he knew not, for, alas! there is no privacy in\\r\\nthe barrack-room. Across the square they went, many{51} an eye being turned\\r\\non the lady, who was pouring forth lamentations the while she wiped her\\r\\neyes with her handkerchief.At that moment Sergeant Barrymore espied the pair, and, understanding\\r\\nwhat had happened, crossed over to them. ‘Madam,’ he said politely, ‘I\\r\\ncan see from the likeness between you and Jack that you are his mother.\\r\\nIf you will step across to my quarters my wife will be happy to offer\\r\\nyou a cup of tea.’Jack looked the thanks he could not express, and Mrs Blair said, ‘Thank\\r\\nyou, I will go to my son’s room.’Jack had to explain that he shared his room in common with many others,\\r\\nand begged that she would accompany him to the sergeant’s quarters.After Mrs Barrymore had assisted the old lady to take off her bonnet and\\r\\ngloves, she came and sat on the sofa beside her son, and taking his hand\\r\\nsaid, ‘Oh John, why on earth have you done this foolish thing?’Jack explained the circumstances under which he had left Phogg &\\r\\nCheetham’s; how Barrymore had rescued him from the tramps; and how,\\r\\ndespairing of ever getting another situation, he had enlisted. ‘Mr\\r\\nBailey told me that whatever happened I must not be a burden to you,’ he\\r\\nsaid, ‘and this seemed to open a career to me. I like the life and think\\r\\nI shall be happy; there are plenty of chances of promotion for a\\r\\nwell-behaved, educated lad.’‘That interfering Bailey! he had no business to say anything of the\\r\\nkind,’ said Mrs Blair. ‘You should have come home at once, John. Your\\r\\nsisters and I would have welcomed you with open arms, and we{52} would have\\r\\nshared our last crust with you. Did we ever give you a wry word that you\\r\\nshould have thought yourself compelled to take such a terrible step as\\r\\nthis?’‘It was because I knew you would do all this that I determined not to be\\r\\na burden to you,’ said Jack. ‘I have got to make my own way in the\\r\\nworld, and the sooner I begin the better. I would a thousand times\\r\\nrather be a soldier than a quill-driver.’‘As an officer I should not have minded so much, but as a private\\r\\nsoldier—no, it must not be. You know that although I have been on\\r\\ndistant terms with my family ever since I married your late dear father,\\r\\nthey are in good circumstances. My brother is a colonel and holds an\\r\\nappointment at the Horse Guards. I shall write to him and beg of him to\\r\\nprocure your discharge.’‘Mother,’ said Jack firmly, ‘this you must not do. Ask no favours for\\r\\nme. It would cost a lot of money to buy me out, and I will not be\\r\\nbeholden to those people who cast you off. Besides, I should be still in\\r\\nthe same position; I should have no career before me. So, as I have\\r\\nchosen this life, I will stick to it.’At tea-time Sergeant Barrymore assured Mrs Blair that her son had done\\r\\nnothing derogatory. ‘One of the best officers in our regiment,’ he said,\\r\\n‘is a man who won his commission from the ranks. Your son has chosen an\\r\\nhonourable career and joined one of the finest regiments in the service.\\r\\nLet him remain, madam, and you will have no cause to regret it. I have\\r\\ngreat hopes of Master Jack.’The superior manner of the sergeant and the air of comfort about his\\r\\nquarters rather impressed Mrs Blair and she began to think that a\\r\\nsoldier’s life was{53} not altogether the common, low drudgery, with men\\r\\nlittle better than convicts for companions, which she had thought it;\\r\\nand when later on Jack took her down to the station and saw her off by\\r\\ntrain she was to a certain extent reconciled to the idea. Dearly as he\\r\\nloved his mother, Jack heaved a half-sigh of relief as her train steamed\\r\\nout, and he thanked his lucky stars that she had not seen the ordinary\\r\\nbarrack-room or realised the actual conditions of the life to which he\\r\\nhad pledged himself for twelve long years.He reached barracks only just before ‘First post’ was sounded, and went\\r\\nstraight to his room. When he got there he found the occupants thereof\\r\\nrather noisy.Napper was sitting on the table, with a pipe in his mouth, relating\\r\\nsomething to the others which was making them laugh loudly. As Jack came\\r\\nin he looked up and cried out, ‘Talk of the er—commander-in-chief and\\r\\nyou’ll hear his wings or his spurs. Why, here is our mammy’s darling.\\r\\n“Oh John, John, to think that I should ever see you in the garb of a\\r\\ncommon soldier”—boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo;’ and the bully pretended to\\r\\ncry loudly.Jack, his heart heavy with having just parted from his mother, felt his\\r\\nblood boil at these words; but he said nothing, only crossed to his bed,\\r\\nwhich he proceeded to take down.‘Not she,’ cried Napper; ‘the old washerwoman hadn’t got the twopence to\\r\\nspare. She’d want that{54} for a drop of gin on the way home. Her nose\\r\\nshowed where all her twopences went.’At this gross insult Jack fairly shook with rage; but he determined to\\r\\ngovern his temper as long as he could.‘How did the old girl get a holiday to come and see you?’ asked Napper\\r\\nagain. ‘Or does her laundry shut early on Saturdays?’Jack had removed his cap and jacket, and busied himself with his bed,\\r\\nwhen Napper, picking up a wet cloth which lay on the table, threw it at\\r\\nJack, saying, ‘Send that up to the old puddin’-boiler and ask her to\\r\\nwash it for us when she is sober.’Jack waited for no more. He picked up the cloth and dashed it in his\\r\\ntormentor’s face. ‘There’s your washing back again,’ he said, ‘and\\r\\nhere’s my intimation to you that if you ever open your foul mouth in my\\r\\npresence to say anything disrespectful of my mother again I’ll wring\\r\\nyour nose.’ Then seizing Napper by the collar of his jacket, he shook\\r\\nhim till that gentleman’s head seemed for a moment to be in danger of\\r\\ncoming off.‘You scum, you washerwoman’s brat!’ yelled Napper, jumping to his feet.\\r\\n‘What do you mean by that?’ and he made a furious rush at Jack.He was met by a well-planted blow between the eyes which laid him flat\\r\\non his back, and Jack said, ‘It means, Bully Napper, that you and I must\\r\\nsettle once and for all who is going to be master here.{55}’‘Hallo, Napper’s got it!’ ‘A mill, a mill!’ ‘Now you’re in for it,\\r\\nBlair!’ ‘Make a ring.’ ‘Give him a chance,’ and so on.In the midst of these outcries Napper rose to his feet. ‘Run and fetch\\r\\nCharlie Lumsden,’ he cried; and a youngster going, returned in a few\\r\\nmoments with Bandsman Lumsden, who was Napper’s particular chum, being\\r\\nthe same man Jack, on his first appearance in the room, had seen talking\\r\\nto Napper.‘I’m going to lick the life out of this cheeky young beast,’ said Napper\\r\\nangrily; ‘and I want you to see me through, Charlie, and bear evidence\\r\\nthat it was a fair fight and no murder.’‘What’s the good of milling?’ said Lumsden. ‘Give the beggar a couple of\\r\\ndozen with a strap and have done with it.’While this talk was going on, willing hands had removed the planks and\\r\\ntrestles which formed the table, the forms were pushed back, and a space\\r\\nin the centre of the room cleared.Directly Jack had dashed the cloth in Napper’s face, Will Hodson, seeing\\r\\nthat trouble was bound to follow, had announced his intention of seeing\\r\\nJack through; but Tom Gallon, who bore the marks of{56} Napper’s brutality\\r\\nupon his chin and mouth, with hatred shining in his eyes, cried, ‘Let me\\r\\nstand by Blair, Will; I can do more for the man who’s got pluck enough\\r\\nto face that cowardly hound than anybody else will.’Lumsden continued to persuade his chum that a good strapping was what\\r\\nJack wanted, and pointed out that a full bandsman was lowering himself\\r\\nto fight with a raw recruit.It flashed across Jack’s mind that if Lumsden and Napper combined, the\\r\\none holding him while the other strapped him, he would stand a poor\\r\\nchance, and his opportunity of obtaining a victory over Napper would be\\r\\nlost. He therefore stepped up to the pair, and, looking at Lumsden,\\r\\ncried, ‘Now, is your man going to stand up or is he going to apologise\\r\\nfor his language?’Lumsden looked at Jack and broke into a loud laugh. ‘Upon my soul,\\r\\nSammy,’ he said, ‘he’s the cockiest kid I’ve seen yet. I do believe\\r\\nyou’ll have to lick him after all.’Napper required no second bidding. He sprang into the ring formed by the\\r\\nspectators and made a furious rush at Jack. This the latter, who was as\\r\\nactive as a panther, avoided, getting in a sly tap on Napper’s ribs as\\r\\nhe rushed past him.Then they faced again, Jack falling back before Napper all the time,\\r\\nkeeping away from his sweeping, sledge-hammer blows and his hug, for he\\r\\nsaw at once that at close-quarters he would stand a poor chance against\\r\\nhis older and heavier opponent.The way in which Jack eluded his savage rushes{57} and sweeping blows\\r\\nmaddened and annoyed Napper, who began to get pumped with his exertions;\\r\\nbut he presently got in a blow which caught Jack on the left cheek and\\r\\nmade his teeth rattle again.‘Try and keep away from his slogging blows,’ whispered Hodson; ‘you\\r\\nstand a good chance if you hang on a bit.’In the second round Napper came on triumphantly, apparently only waiting\\r\\nan opportunity to rush in and smash his opponent up once and for all.\\r\\nBut that he found was more difficult to perform than he imagined. It was\\r\\nscience versus strength, and provided only that science could hold on\\r\\nlong enough it stood a very good chance of winning.Seeing an opening after Napper had made one of his futile rushes, Jack\\r\\ngot in one too, a regular postman’s knock on his chest, and when time\\r\\nwas called Napper did not feel nearly so confident. A couple of similar\\r\\nrounds now followed, and it was curious to note the effect on the\\r\\nbystanders of Jack’s improving chances. At first, when he made a good\\r\\nhit they looked at one another as though to say, ‘Well done!’ but had\\r\\nexpressed no opinion aloud. But when it was seen he was holding his own\\r\\nwell there were frequent outbursts of ‘Well hit, Blair!’ ‘Well done,\\r\\n‘Cruity!’ and so on.Jack was not escaping scot-free, and when he came up for the fifth round\\r\\none eye was almost closed. Napper, however, was getting very puffed; he\\r\\nwas{58} not nearly in such good condition as Jack, and he could not now\\r\\nfollow him up so quickly. His breathing was laboured and heavy, and his\\r\\nsledge-hammer blows not so frequent.Jack then altered his tactics. In an instant he changed from a defensive\\r\\nto an offensive policy; flew at Napper, used his fists with amazing\\r\\nrapidity, and before his astonished enemy realised what was happening\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen straight, heavy blows had fallen on his head and body.At the beginning of the next round Napper was beginning to show signs of\\r\\nheavy punishment. In avoiding a rush, Jack bent over till his right\\r\\nforearm rested on his right thigh, and swinging round his left with a\\r\\ncircular motion he got in right between Napper’s eyes. He followed up\\r\\nhis advantage, and, after several stunning blows on the head, with a\\r\\nleft-hander just over Napper’s heart he laid him flat down at Lumsden’s\\r\\nfeet.Jack waited for Napper to rise; but there was no more fight left in that\\r\\ngentleman. ‘Has your man had enough?’ asked Jack of Lumsden.Then a strange thing happened. The trumpeters in room B2 realised that\\r\\nthe reign of Bully Napper was over.The boys were silenced, and while Lumsden bathed Napper’s head and face\\r\\nin cold water the room was quickly got into order again.{59}All sorts of congratulations were offered to Jack; but he took no notice\\r\\nof them and was soon in bed, the last thing he heard before he fell\\r\\nasleep being a groan from Napper as he turned over upon some\\r\\nparticularly tender spot.{60}He said nothing during breakfast; but once or twice Jack caught him\\r\\nlooking in a fashion that boded him little good if Napper ever had a\\r\\nchance of doing him an ill-turn. As soon as breakfast was over Napper\\r\\nwent to hospital and reported himself sick, and there he stayed for a\\r\\nday or two, nominally suffering from a ‘swollen face.’No official notice was taken of the matter, though Jack had been rather\\r\\nafraid at first that he might get into trouble for ‘fighting in\\r\\nbarracks.’ Indeed, it came to his ears later that both the trumpet-major\\r\\nand Sergeant Linham had expressed themselves pleased that Napper had\\r\\nbeen given a sharp lesson, for his bullying propensities were well\\r\\nknown.On the Sunday morning there was church parade, and a pretty sight,\\r\\nindeed, the regiment presented as in full-dress, dismounted and carrying\\r\\nswords only, headed by their splendid band, they marched off. Jack’s\\r\\nheart glowed with pride to think that these gaily apparelled Lancers\\r\\nwere his comrades, and that he, too, was now one of the ‘Death or Glory\\r\\nBoys.{61}’On Monday Jack was informed that next day he was to join the recruit\\r\\nsquad in the riding-school. This news gave him genuine delight, for he\\r\\nwas exceedingly fond of horses and longed to have one of his own.\\r\\nAccordingly, next morning, in undress uniform and without spurs, Jack\\r\\nparaded with the squad of recruits with whom he had been doing extension\\r\\ndrill.They went off to the stables, where they took possession of their\\r\\nhorses. Jack was given a pretty animal that he quite fell in love with\\r\\nat the first glance. She had belonged to a bandsman who had just left\\r\\nthe regiment, and was a very pretty bay, as were most of the\\r\\nband-horses. She was rather small, but her broad chest and tapering legs\\r\\ndenoted both strength and swiftness. She had an arching neck, and soft,\\r\\nlimpid eyes that looked as intelligent as a human being’s.‘Don’t jar her mouth, youngster,’ said the old soldier who had groomed\\r\\nher, as he handed the bridle to Jack. ‘Use her gently and she’ll carry\\r\\nyou as comfortably as though you were in an arm-chair.’They then went off to the riding-school, and as they entered the\\r\\nrough-riding sergeant seemed to Jack to eye his ‘victims’ with a\\r\\nsinister glance.The men were placed in position, the sergeant standing in the middle,\\r\\narmed with a long whip like a circus-master’s. His assistant\\r\\nrough-riders stood near him, all looking, it seemed to Jack, grimly\\r\\nearnest. The men, being in position, were called sharply up to\\r\\n‘Attention!’‘Spring smartly up,’ cried the sergeant, ‘the left{62} hand holding the\\r\\nsnaffle-rein near the ring, the right arm down, little finger behind the\\r\\nstripe of the overalls.’The assistants saw that the men were in position; then they were\\r\\ninstructed how to stand on the command, ‘Prepare to mount!’‘On the command “Mount!”’ continued the sergeant, ‘place the right hand\\r\\non the horse’s withers, then spring lightly up, remaining perfectly\\r\\nstill when seated.’Of the eleven men in the squad, only four managed to get on their\\r\\nhorses’ backs; some of the others were sprawling wildly on their\\r\\nstomachs on the horses’ backs, endeavouring madly to throw the right leg\\r\\nover; while one heavy fellow named Wilson had bumped against his horse\\r\\nwith so much force that the animal reared away, and Wilson, hanging\\r\\nwildly to the bridle with both hands, was dragged along, shouting, ‘Whoa\\r\\nthere! whoa, back!’‘Walk march,’ said the sergeant; and the well-trained animals, without\\r\\nany intimation from their riders, began to step round the school.{63}‘Legs well down, heels in line with the shoulders, toes raised, back\\r\\nwell hollowed in! Now, you Wilson fellow, sit up; man, you’re like a\\r\\nsack of bran tied up ugly! Sit up, the horse’s back won’t break.’‘Now we’ll try a trot. Keep your heads well up, press your knees in, let\\r\\nthe horses throw you up and down, and ride by the balance of your\\r\\nbodies! But, mind, don’t lose your position or jerk the horses’ mouths!’What a sight was there. As the horses trotted round the men wobbled\\r\\nabout, and several looked absolutely scared.Wilson obeyed by completely losing his balance, then clinging wildly\\r\\nround the horse’s neck, one leg across the animal’s back, the other toe\\r\\njust hopping along on the ground.‘Oh you dashed tailor! oh you cobbler!’ roared the sergeant. ‘Why didn’t\\r\\nyou join the Militia. Who sent you here for a Lancer?’The horses stopped so suddenly that two more luckless wights pitched\\r\\nover their horses’ heads and lay wallowing on the tan. More cutting\\r\\nremarks{64} from the sergeant, then the squad again ‘stood to their\\r\\nhorses,’ and were once more instructed in the method of mounting. This\\r\\ntime poor Wilson made such a leap that he shot right over his horse’s\\r\\nback and fell off on the other side, roaring lustily.‘You’re not in the gymnasium on the vaulting-horse,’ roared the\\r\\nsergeant. ‘Look up, man, or you’ll put in the whole of your twelve in\\r\\nthe riding-school.’Presently the men again got mounted and the ride went on. Jack, being\\r\\nlight and agile, and his horse docile, managed very well, and soon began\\r\\nto feel confidence, remembering the old soldier’s words, not to ‘jar her\\r\\nmouth.’In about an hour’s time the riding-master and a rather short but very\\r\\nbroad officer, whom Jack afterwards learnt was Captain Norreys, entered\\r\\nthe school, and the recruits were handled a little more gently.Presently Captain Norreys and the riding-master, who had noticed how\\r\\nwell Jack was getting on, came up to him, and the captain said kindly,\\r\\n‘What is your name, my lad?’‘You’re doing very well, Blair; very well. We shall soon make a\\r\\ncavalryman of you. Go on as you have begun.’ And Jack’s heart warmed\\r\\nwithin him at the kindly words.Presently the ride was dismissed and the horses taken back to the\\r\\nstables. Despite his stiffness and soreness, Jack thoroughly enjoyed his\\r\\nride, and was quite eager to begin again, the kindly notice taken of him\\r\\nby the riding-master and Captain Norreys filling him with pleasure.{65}On the Thursday, Napper resumed his duties. He took up his old position\\r\\nwithout a word, retaining his loud and domineering manner, and smoking\\r\\nand frequenting the canteen as much as before; but Tommy Callon was no\\r\\nlonger a sort of valet to him, nor did any one do his pipeclaying and\\r\\nburnishing. Also, he studiously let Jack alone; so peace reigned. This\\r\\nwas the more so as the band was then playing a good deal at London,\\r\\nRichmond, Kew, and other places; so that Napper was much away.Jack got on splendidly with his trumpet and bugle work, and Linham\\r\\ndeclared that Blair was a credit to him, ending up with a tremendous\\r\\n‘Ha, hum!’ that clinched the matter.He soon got very attached to his horse Dainty, which was indeed a\\r\\nbeautiful and docile creature, whinnying when Jack went into the stable,\\r\\nrubbing her velvet muzzle against his face when he spoke to her, and\\r\\nreaching out towards his hand in expectation of the usual lump of sugar\\r\\nhe brought her.Jack, being a big boy for his age, was drilled with his squad both in\\r\\nthe lance and sword exercise, for the colonel of the Lancers was a man\\r\\nwho insisted upon his trumpeters being soldiers as well. With Sergeant\\r\\nLinham he seemed to be quite a favourite. The sergeant was a first-class\\r\\nsoldier, one of those in whom discipline is second nature, and whose\\r\\nwhole knowledge of life is limited to the service. Jack was once\\r\\nspeaking of him to Sergeant Barrymore.‘He is a queer fish, is Jimmy,’ said Barrymore; ‘but a truer comrade\\r\\nnever lived, and he’s a great friend of the colonel’s too!’‘He is, indeed. I’ll guarantee there’s not a man{66} in the regiment,\\r\\nincluding the officers, that the colonel thinks as much of, or is really\\r\\nso fond of, as he is of Jimmy Linham.’‘It’s a fact, I can assure you,’ said Barrymore. ‘How otherwise do you\\r\\nthink Jimmy got his stripes? Not for his trumpeting qualities, for, as\\r\\nyou know, he’s a poor hand at that. No, my boy, Jimmy Linham wears those\\r\\nstripes because he’s a friend of the colonel’s. They were together in\\r\\nthe 16th, our colonel as a young cornet and Linham as trumpeter. They\\r\\nhad some terrible experiences in Afghanistan together, and both suffered\\r\\nlosses. They went together through the Sikh war of ‘40, and took part in\\r\\nsome of the fiercest fights. I never heard the exact rights of it, but I\\r\\nknow Jimmy and the colonel have some sort of a common bond of sympathy\\r\\nthat binds them together. The colonel brought Linham with him when he\\r\\ncame to ours, and he made him sergeant, and sergeant he’ll remain as\\r\\nlong as the colonel is with us.’Time went on, and Jack, being really fond of his work, and having a\\r\\nnatural aptitude for soldiering, made splendid progress. At the end of\\r\\nabout three months the trumpet-major came down one morning to the\\r\\npractice, and calling Jack out in front of his squad, made him sound\\r\\nthirty or forty calls, both on trumpet and bugle. Jack did his best and\\r\\nfelt he had fairly well acquitted himself. He had worked hard during his\\r\\nspare time, for he was anxious to take up his regular duties.In the evening, while he was engaged on what is termed\\r\\n‘soldiering’—that is, cleaning his kit and{67} accoutrements—Sergeant\\r\\nLinham, looking preternaturally solemn, entered the room with the\\r\\nsuddenness that characterised his movements.‘Right, sergeant,’ and Jack slipped into his jacket and adjusted his\\r\\nforage-cap to the required angle, while Hodson ran a cloth-brush over\\r\\nhim.‘I don’t want to frighten you, Jack,’ said that Job’s comforter; ‘but at\\r\\nthis moment I’d sooner be in my boots than in yours. I should say some\\r\\none has spotted an unpipeclayed belt of yours, you’ve got an\\r\\nunfavourable report from riding-school or drill, or you’ve failed to\\r\\nsalute some officer, or’——‘Oh shut up, Will; you’ll hang me before I’m tried;’ and Jack started\\r\\noff for the trumpet-major’s quarters, being rendered none the easier in\\r\\nhis mind by noticing as he left the room the evil grin on Napper’s face.It was with some trepidation that Jack entered the trumpet-major’s\\r\\nquarters in response to the shouted ‘Come in,’ after he had knocked; but\\r\\nthe friendly look with which he was greeted did much towards putting him\\r\\nat his ease.‘Oh Blair,’ said the trumpet-major, ‘I wanted to see you. I’m very\\r\\npleased at the progress you’ve made—very. So far as your ability to\\r\\nsound is concerned you’re quite fit to take duty with the others, and\\r\\nthe riding-master tells me he shall soon dismiss you from the rides.\\r\\nYou’ve done very well.{68}’‘You’ve done so well that I’m going to get you posted to a troop’ said\\r\\nthe trumpet-major. ‘Brittain, of D Troop, is going into the band, and I\\r\\nshall send you in his place. You can don the cross-trumpets as soon as\\r\\nyou like.’This news was more than ever agreeable to Jack. D Troop was Captain\\r\\nNorrey’s and Sergeant Barrymore’s, so that Jack felt that he would be\\r\\namongst those whom he liked best.‘As you won’t join your troop till next week,’ said the trumpet-major\\r\\nkindly, ‘how would you like a day or two of leave? You’ve got people\\r\\nsomewhere near, haven’t you?’Jack’s heart gave a prodigious leap. ‘I have,’ he replied, ‘and I should\\r\\nlike above all things to see them.’‘Very well, then. To-day’s Tuesday; I will arrange for you to have from\\r\\nFriday night till next Tuesday. How’ll that do?’Full of delight, Jack went, and on his return every one in his room was\\r\\nglad to hear his news except Napper, who scowled evilly at him.On the following evening Jack, as was the custom amongst the trumpeters\\r\\nwhen posted to a troop, stood treat to his chums, and there was a great\\r\\nconsumption of sausages, jam-rolls, apples, and cocoa. Sergeant Linham,\\r\\nlooking in by chance during the evening, drank Jack’s health. Napper\\r\\ncame in late and looked daggers at everybody; but no one took any notice\\r\\nof him.On the Friday, arrayed in full dress, wearing his{69} trumpeter’s badge,\\r\\nJack started for home, feeling as happy as a sand-boy. In due course he\\r\\nreached the little crescent in Camden Town in which his family lived.\\r\\nThere were a number of not overclean children playing in the street, and\\r\\nnot overtidy women standing here and there at their doors. Used as he\\r\\nwas to the roominess and order of barracks, this struck Jack painfully.\\r\\nClarence Crescent seemed to him dingier even than when he had left it to\\r\\ntake up his duties at Messrs Phogg & Cheetham’s, and when he thought of\\r\\nthe large house and beautiful garden which had been theirs in the old\\r\\ndays he could hardly repress a sigh. He, however, paid little heed to\\r\\nwomen and children, his eyes were fixed on the upper windows of a house\\r\\nabout half-way down the street. There he saw several faces, the owners\\r\\nof which had no sooner observed the young soldier than they disappeared.\\r\\nBefore Jack could reach the doorstep, his mother and three young girls\\r\\nhad the door opened, waiting for him, and in another moment he was\\r\\nsimply surrounded by clinging arms.‘Dear old Jack, welcome home!’ cried Molly, a fair-haired, handsome\\r\\ngirl, the very counterpart of Jack.‘Let’s get inside,’ said Jack, who did not appreciate the audience\\r\\ngathering round the door. This was closed, and the whole family went\\r\\nupstairs to their little sitting-room.‘Very well, my dear boy,’ she replied, kissing her{70} son; ‘but how you\\r\\nhave grown! What a great fellow you’re getting!’Jack laughed happily. How good it was to be at home! Soon tea was on the\\r\\ntable. The family drew up, and Jack had to tell them all about his new\\r\\nlife—that is, all the pleasant parts; the darker side he hid from them.The few days that Jack spent among his family he always looked back upon\\r\\nas amongst the happiest of his life; and when the time came for him to\\r\\nsay ‘Good-bye,’ and mother and sisters were in tears, it was as much as\\r\\nJack could do to restrain his own. He, however, remembered he was a\\r\\nsoldier, and went off bravely. He reached barracks all right, and at\\r\\nonce reported himself to the trumpet-major.‘You’re in ample time, Blair; a good rule,’ said the trumpet-major.\\r\\n‘Always aim at being a day too soon rather than a moment too late.’Jack’s comrades welcomed him warmly when he entered the room, and asked\\r\\nhim all sorts of questions as to what he had been doing; but Jack gave\\r\\nthem little information, for to his comrades of the barrack-room his\\r\\nhome-life and his family were as a sealed book.The familiar sounds of reveille woke him in the morning, and in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour he had taken his place again in the new life, and began to\\r\\nfeel at home again in barracks. He took up his new duties, Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore expressing his pleasure at Jack having been posted to his\\r\\ntroop.Jack grew in popularity with his superiors and with his comrades, while\\r\\nNapper sank in their estimation. He tried in every way to annoy Jack,\\r\\nbut the latter always defeated his attempts.{71}On the following Thursday morning they started, and a very pleasant\\r\\nmarch they had. In the afternoon they reached the camp, pitched tents,\\r\\nand settled down in glorious weather. All arms were represented, and the\\r\\nmen enjoyed the affair immensely. On the Saturday there was a big\\r\\nfield-day, Jack’s regiment representing the attacking cavalry.About midday the ‘Cease fire,’ was sounded, and Jack’s troop was halted\\r\\nat an old-fashioned inn standing on the heath. As they dismounted, Jack\\r\\nnoticed that the band of the regiment were standing and sitting about as\\r\\nthough they had been halted there while the rest of the regiment had\\r\\nbeen engaged in the field. He loosened his saddle-girths and fastened\\r\\nDainty’s bridle to the pillar of a little rustic arbour beside the inn,\\r\\nwhile he went inside to get a crust of bread and cheese. In a few\\r\\nminutes an orderly galloped up, bringing word from the colonel that the\\r\\ntroop was to rejoin the regiment at once to form up for the march past.As Jack went towards the little arbour, to his surprise he saw Napper\\r\\nglide out, hurry away towards the band, most of whom were already\\r\\nmounted, and swing himself into the saddle. Hastily tightening up his\\r\\ngirths, Jack mounted just as the band trotted off.{72}Dainty was strangely restive, pawing the ground, tossing her head, and\\r\\nfidgeting about. Jack tried to calm her as he fell in with his troop;\\r\\nbut Dainty, instead of keeping her position just behind the captain’s\\r\\nhorse, was prancing and curveting all over the road. Jack patted her and\\r\\nuttered soothing words; then tried touching the curb and letting her\\r\\nfeel the spur. But it was all to no purpose. There was no opportunity of\\r\\ndismounting to see what ailed her, for immediately on coming up with the\\r\\nregiment, while the band trotted off to take its place at the saluting\\r\\nbase with the other bands, Jack’s troop wheeled with C Troop into column\\r\\nof squadrons, and advanced at a walk to take up ground for the march\\r\\npast. Dainty got quieter, and Jack spoke endearing words to her, for she\\r\\nwas a beautiful creature and Jack had a true cavalryman’s love for his\\r\\nhorse.Presently, the regiment being in line, the march past commenced, and by\\r\\na great effort Jack managed to keep his horse under control and in its\\r\\nplace, which was well for him, for the eyes of his captain were on him,\\r\\nand woe to the man who broke the line. When the regiment broke into a\\r\\ntrot Dainty got almost unmanageable, and the perspiration broke out all\\r\\nover Jack through the struggle between him and his horse.Then came the final charge. The Horse Artillery thundered by at a\\r\\ngallop, its guns jolting and bumping; then the Lancers and Hussars in a\\r\\nlong double line, with lances in rest and waving sabres, galloped madly\\r\\nforward, right on to the front of the thousands of spectators. As the\\r\\nregiment galloped on Dainty got more and more unmanageable, and the\\r\\nthunder of fifteen hundred hoofs, the clank and jangle of\\r\\nac{73}coutrements, the loud shouts of the troopers, all tended to render\\r\\nthe bay still more wild. She raced along, kicking and plunging, her ears\\r\\ndown, shaking her head angrily, and Jack had all he could do to hold her\\r\\nin and prevent her passing the squadron leaders.The line of spectators watching the advancing horsemen got closer and\\r\\ncloser till the colonel held his sword aloft, his trumpeter rang out the\\r\\nhalt, and men and officers pulled up dead and began dressing their\\r\\nlines.Jack drew hard on his bridle, but Dainty never paused for a second. Like\\r\\na flash she shot past the squadron leaders, and with an angry snort went\\r\\nstraight at the spectators in front. Jack realised the awful danger of a\\r\\ncatastrophe, and dropping his bugle he seized the bridle with both hands\\r\\nand tugged with all his might at his horse’s head. Futile effort; Dainty\\r\\nhad got the bit between her teeth and was racing forward. Jack knew the\\r\\nhorse had run away with him, and shouted at the top of his voice to the\\r\\npeople in front to get out of his way. This several did, with loud cries\\r\\nof fear; but a nurse-girl, who had charge of a chubby little boy of some\\r\\nthree or four, seemed paralysed by fear and stood rooted to the spot.\\r\\nHer charge, the sun gleaming on his golden curly hair, ran out right in\\r\\nfront of the maddened horse, and a great cry of horror went up from\\r\\nthose around.Nerved to an almost superhuman effort by the thought of the danger of\\r\\nthe laughing child almost under his charger’s hoofs, Jack threw forward\\r\\nhis feet, getting a good grip on his stirrups, then with all his\\r\\nstrength he wrenched Dainty’s mouth till she threw up her head. Lying\\r\\nback, he dragged at her{74} till her head was pulled back right against his\\r\\nchest. The animal reared almost straight up on her hind-legs and\\r\\nremained some seconds, while the child’s nurse, recovering from her\\r\\nstupor, rushed forward, dragged the little boy right from under the\\r\\niron-shod hoofs pawing the air above him, and in an instant had the\\r\\nchild in safety, when she fell in a swoon.Jack, just as he heard the thudding of hoofs behind him, slipped off\\r\\nover the hind-quarters of Dainty; and then, still gripping the bridle,\\r\\nhe pulled her sharply backward, when she overbalanced and came right\\r\\nover on her back, dashing Jack to the ground with her. Before she could\\r\\nscramble to her feet and start off again, Jack saw a number of mounted\\r\\nfigures close round him and his horse. Dainty was captured, and some one\\r\\ndismounting ran towards Jack just as he lost consciousness. He soon,\\r\\nhowever, came to himself to find the regimental doctor feeling for\\r\\nbroken limbs, and a newly joined officer, Cornet Leland of his troop,\\r\\nsupporting his head.Jack, fearing that he had made but a sorry exhibition of horsemanship,\\r\\nand thinking he might get into trouble for thus bringing his regiment\\r\\ninto unpleasant prominence, struggled to his feet, asserting that he was\\r\\nall right. He saw that a Hussar trumpeter had unsaddled Dainty, who now\\r\\nstood quiet enough while the regimental sergeant-major was examining\\r\\nher.‘I think so, sir,’ replied Jack; and he tried, but his left leg pained\\r\\nhim so much that he almost cried out with the pain. He had been thrown\\r\\non to the hilt of his sword, which had badly bruised his left hip.For many painful hours he lay awake, Will Hodson, Sergeants Linham and\\r\\nBarrymore, and many others dropping in to chat for a few minutes with\\r\\nhim.‘The reason why your horse was so unmanageable was that she had\\r\\nsomething pricking and scratching her all the while,’ said Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore; ‘one side is all torn and lacerated just under the\\r\\nsaddle-girth. You could not have spurred her there if you had tried.\\r\\nIt’s very strange.’It was very strange, and, as well as his aching head would let him, Jack\\r\\ntried to think the matter out; but at last he fell into a troubled sleep\\r\\nwithout arriving at any solution of the mystery.{76}During the afternoon he saw a figure in Hussar uniform threading his way\\r\\namong the tents. He stopped and spoke to a Lancer, who pointed over in\\r\\nJack’s direction, when the Hussar came straight towards him.Jack saw the stranger was a trumpeter apparently about his own age. He\\r\\nlooked at Jack, then with a genial smile came up and held out his hand.‘It’s glad I am to see ye sitting there, honey,’ he said with an Irish\\r\\nbrogue. ‘Shure, I made certain ye’d be in the sawdust.’‘I hope ye will; but bedad, whin I see ye go over yesterday I sez, shure\\r\\nwe’ll be having a grand military funeral directly. I was close to ye,\\r\\nand could see yer horse had bolted; I went after ye wid one or two of\\r\\nyours.’‘Faix, ye did a gallant thing, comrade. Ye managed that horse of yers in\\r\\na way that would{77} have done credit to a rough-rider. It’s here I am to\\r\\ntell ye so.’‘Ye’re perhaps wondering who the dickens I am, and what for should I be\\r\\nblathering to ye. Well, I’m Larry O’Callaghan, full thrumpeter, A Troop,\\r\\n8th Royal Irish Hussars, son of the late thrumpet-major of the rigiment,\\r\\nand, plase the saints, I intind to be thrumpet-major meself some day.’‘I’m glad to know ye, comrade. I took a fancy to ye when I see ye\\r\\nfighting wid that mare of yers. And now, I want to know who was the mane\\r\\nthafe of the wurrld who played ye such a dhirty trick yesterday. I’m\\r\\nopen to punch his head for him, whoever he is.’‘Av coorse I haven’t tould ye yet. ‘Twas I, ye know, who caught the mare\\r\\nand held her when she was trying to kick her head off. The saddle had\\r\\nshifted, and after some of yers had come up and held the mare, one of\\r\\nyer sargints told me to fix the saddle again. When I undid the girths to\\r\\ntwist the saddle round I found these;’ and the young Hussar produced\\r\\nfrom inside his jacket two large chestnut burrs, hard and prickly.\\r\\n‘These had bin shoved in under the girths,’ he said, ‘and was prickin’\\r\\nand tearin’ her till she was almost mad.’Jack took the burrs in his hand. They were covered with bay hairs and\\r\\nstained with blood. An angry frown settled on his face.‘Much too bad, comrade,’ said Larry earnestly. ‘The man who played ye\\r\\nthat trick wanted ye to break yer neck.’In a flash Jack recalled the fact of having seen Napper sneaking from\\r\\nthe little arbour of the inn on the day before. Had he done this? It was\\r\\njust after that time that Dainty had grown so restless. Jack, however,\\r\\ndetermined to say nothing till he had proof.Larry and Jack sat talking for some time, enjoying the sight of the\\r\\nhundreds of visitors to the camp, and laughing at many of the remarks\\r\\nthey made about things military.Suddenly Sergeant Linham appeared before them. ‘Ha, hum!’ he snorted.\\r\\n‘Here, you 8th Hussar man, what are you doing here? The men are to keep\\r\\nin their own lines to-day; general order.’ And he blew violently down\\r\\nhis nose.‘All right, sargint darlint,’ said Larry, ‘though ye needn’t blow yer\\r\\nnose off. I came over from our colonel to ask how was the thrumpeter who\\r\\nwas hurt yesterday.’‘Oh indeed, ha, yes! thoughtful and kind, very. But you’d better go.\\r\\nRight-about turn! Quick march!’ Then to Jack he said hurriedly, ‘Mr\\r\\nLeland and some friends are on their way to see you. Pull down your\\r\\njacket, and your cap’s not right—so; that’s better. You ought to be in\\r\\nfull-dress, you know. ‘Pon my word, the service is going to the dogs,\\r\\nabsolutely to the dogs. I want to know what the—— ‘Shun!’Jack and Larry at once stood up and saluted as Cornet Leland, in\\r\\nuniform, with a tall, white-headed old gentleman and a young and very\\r\\nhandsome lady,{79} leading a dear little curly-haired boy by the hand,\\r\\nsuddenly appeared.‘Good-afternoon, Blair. How are you feeling?’ asked the cornet, who was\\r\\nnot much older than Jack himself.‘Much better, thank you, sir. I was only shaken yesterday. I shall be\\r\\nable to march to-morrow with the regiment.’‘That’s right.—This is the trumpeter whose horse bolted\\r\\nyesterday.—Blair, this is my uncle, Colonel George Leland. The little\\r\\nboy who almost got under your horse’s hoofs yesterday is his grandson.’Jack turned very red, saluted, and began to apologise. But the old\\r\\ncolonel cut him short, said some most complimentary things to him, in\\r\\nwhich the lady joined, and chatted for some time. He saw at once that\\r\\nJack was many cuts above the ordinary ‘boy-trumpeter,’ and did not\\r\\nattempt to offer him money. He said, however, that he knew Jack’s\\r\\ncolonel well, and that he would see that his action should not go\\r\\nunnoticed.Looking at Larry, the colonel recognised him as the Hussar who had\\r\\nhelped to stop Jack’s horse, and after complimenting him on his plucky\\r\\ndeed dropped a couple of sovereigns into Larry’s palm.‘May the ten blessings fall upon ye and yers, colonel,’ cried the\\r\\ndelighted Larry, saluting him. Then wishing Jack good-bye, he said he\\r\\nwould run over in the morning and see him before his regiment marched\\r\\noff.On his way back to the lines of the Hussars, Larry had to pass the large\\r\\ncanteen, and Sergeant Linham went with him to see he didn’t ‘lose his\\r\\nway.’Soon after the Lelands had gone, a basket of fruit{80} arrived for\\r\\n‘Trumpeter Blair,’ and Will Hodson came up just at the same time. Will\\r\\nhad to chaff Jack about this; but Jack told him not to be a donkey, and\\r\\nrelated the history of the chestnut burrs which Larry O’Callaghan had\\r\\nleft with him. Will’s face grew scarlet with rage. ‘This is too much,’\\r\\nhe said. ‘It’s murder, no less. It must be reported to the colonel.\\r\\nNapper must go; we won’t mix with him.’‘Steady, Will; remember we’ve no proof. I certainly saw Napper in the\\r\\narbour of the inn; but that is all. No one saw him tampering with\\r\\nDainty. Oblige me, Will, by saying nothing yet.’Next morning Jack reported himself fit for duty. He saw nothing of\\r\\nNapper, nor did he want to. Before the Hussars marched off Larry came\\r\\nacross and wished Jack good-bye, saying he hoped they would soon meet\\r\\nagain.Jack was preparing to parade with the rest of his regiment when Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore came up to him. ‘Jack, my boy,’ he said, ‘I’ve good news for\\r\\nyou. We’re going on detachment duty to Hampton Court to relieve F Troop,\\r\\nwhich is to return to the regiment “to be smartened up,” as the adjutant\\r\\nsays.’Jack was as pleased as anybody at the change, and so it happened that\\r\\nwhen the ‘Death or Glory Boys’ marched off, Jack’s troop was left behind\\r\\nto make their way to Hampton Court.{81}One great piece of good news Jack heard, and that was that his mother’s\\r\\naffairs had unexpectedly improved, and that his family were coming down\\r\\nto rent a pretty little cottage at Kingston; and when they arrived Jack\\r\\nwas able to run over and see them three or four times a week. Molly got\\r\\nseveral music-pupils, who paid very well, and things were more\\r\\ncomfortable with the Blairs than they had been since the father’s death.\\r\\nAt Christmas Jack got leave, and a very jolly day they had at Rose\\r\\nCottage.The New Year came in and weeks rolled by. Will Hodson occasionally rode\\r\\nover from the regiment and brought news. Napper was sent to Coventry by\\r\\nthe rest of the trumpeters. Sergeant Linham kept an eye on him, and had\\r\\nit not been that he was an excellent performer and in the good books of\\r\\nthe bandmaster things might have gone awkwardly with him.But there were other topics than Napper to think of just then. During\\r\\nthose early weeks of the year there were persistent rumours of war. War\\r\\nwas in the air—war with Russia or Turkey; the soldiers were not sure\\r\\nwhich, nor did they care. Then, early in February, the Guards left\\r\\nEngland for Malta.{82} They had a rousing reception as they marched through\\r\\nLondon. The wiseacres said there would be no war after all. In spite of\\r\\ntheir prophecy other regiments went, and excitement rose to fever-heat.\\r\\nCavalry were to follow, and every trooper longed for his chance; but no\\r\\nregiments were named.It was on a fine April morning that Jack and his troop were returning\\r\\nfrom exercising the horses when they saw coming along the road towards\\r\\nthem a Lancer in full-dress, his plume and lance-flags fluttering in the\\r\\nwind. On reaching Cornet Leland, the trooper reined in, brought his\\r\\nlance to the ‘carry,’ and handed the officer a long blue official\\r\\nenvelope.Cornet Leland read quickly; then turning to his men cried, ‘Hurrah,\\r\\nboys, we’re under orders for the East; we’ve got the route. We join\\r\\nheadquarters at once.’For a moment the troopers gazed at one another; then a cheer burst from\\r\\nthem that made the occupants of the houses around come running to their\\r\\nwindows to see what was the matter.The orderly returned to Hounslow the richer by half-a-crown, and Cornet\\r\\nLeland, giving his troop the word, started at a trot for their quarters.From the moment the news was received there was but one topic of\\r\\nconversation—war was declared and the 17th were going. Jack went over\\r\\nto Rose Cottage that evening and found a sorrowful family. They had\\r\\nalready seen in the papers that Jack’s regiment was under orders for the\\r\\nEast, and the news filled them with consternation.Jack had to reason with his relatives. ‘It’s a soldier’s duty to fight,’\\r\\nhe said; ‘that is what we are paid and trained for.{83}’But his arguments did little to console his relatives. It was all right\\r\\nfor others to go; but for their own Jack—that was different. Still, the\\r\\nparting had to come, and it was so painful that Jack felt he could not\\r\\nendure another such ordeal before he embarked. It unnerved him, and for\\r\\nworlds he would not appear downcast before his comrades.Jack’s troop rejoined headquarters and found everything in a state of\\r\\ngreat excitement. Will was delighted to have Jack with him again, and\\r\\ntold him all the news. The next morning headquarters, with which was\\r\\nNapper, started for Portsmouth, whence they were to embark; the scenes\\r\\nof parting before the men mounted—wives, fathers, children, snatching a\\r\\nlast embrace, a final kiss, as the trumpet sounded the parade—being\\r\\nvery painful.When next morning Jack’s troop paraded, the scenes of the day before\\r\\nwere repeated. As they passed through the gates with the band of a\\r\\nDragoon regiment playing ‘Annie Laurie,’ pale-faced women clung to the\\r\\nstirrup-leathers of many of the men and went with them among the\\r\\ncheering thousands outside. About a mile from the barracks the trumpet\\r\\nsounded the ‘trot,’ and these poor wretches were left behind.After a time the ‘walk march’ was again resumed, and the men broke out\\r\\ninto a song at that time very popular, the words of which the troops\\r\\nslightly altered to suit the war-fever:‘They’d better wait till they’ve done a bit of fight{84}ing,’ growled\\r\\nLinham; ‘then perhaps they won’t have so much breath for cheering.’On the third day Jack’s troop reached Cosham, and there they were\\r\\nbilleted until the ship that was to convey them to the East was ready.\\r\\nThis was in two days’ time, and then, in spick and span order, the troop\\r\\nmarched into Portsmouth. The band of the gallant Cameronians came out to\\r\\nplay them into the town, and through cheering thousands they marched.They went straight to the docks, and there Jack found Will, and was\\r\\ndelighted to learn they were both going in the same ship, the Eveline.\\r\\nIt took some time to get all aboard, both men and horses; but at last,\\r\\neverything being finished, Jack and Will found themselves on deck taking\\r\\ntheir last look for many and many a month at an English crowd of\\r\\ncivilians. After the usual delays and bustle and scurry, the anchor was\\r\\nweighed, and amidst the ringing cheers of thousands of spectators the\\r\\nEveline stood gently out across the Solent.Well for them that neither of them could foresee, for the date was April\\r\\n25th, and that day six months was the day of the death-ride of the\\r\\nimmortal ‘Six Hundred.{85}’The colonel kept his men pretty busy, and Jack soon had enough to do.\\r\\nThe second deck had been fitted up as a mess-deck for the men, and below\\r\\nthat was the horse-deck. This was separated longitudinally into three\\r\\ndivisions, the horses standing on each side with their heads facing\\r\\ninwards, the centre walk being for the men. Each horse was separated\\r\\nfrom its companion by a barrier, and had a sling beneath it to prevent\\r\\nslipping.Necessarily a good part of the day was spent at ‘stables,’ as tending\\r\\nthe horses was still called; then there was drill when the weather\\r\\npermitted, and various parades.There was a good deal of skylarking going on, and much ingenuity was\\r\\noften displayed in devising practical jokes. In the evening the men\\r\\nwould gather on the forecastle and smoke and tell yarns, those who had\\r\\nalready seen service being eagerly{86} listened to as they told tales of\\r\\nhairbreadth escapes or thrilling deeds.Jack and his comrades were thus sitting one fine night, when Sergeant\\r\\nLinham, taking his pipe from his mouth, blew violently down his nose,\\r\\nand prefacing his remarks with his usual exclamation, said, ‘Now I want\\r\\nto know what in all goodness have the Turks to do with this affair? What\\r\\nare we going to fight the Russians for, and where are we going to begin,\\r\\nfor no one at present seems to know?’‘You want to know a good deal, sergeant,’ said a trooper named Pearson.\\r\\n‘As far as I can make out, the Czar’s trying to collar Turkey, and we’re\\r\\ngoing to stop him. Anyway, we’re going to have a dust-up; that’s all I\\r\\ncare about.’‘Just like all the other fools,’ said Linham scornfully; ‘no matter what\\r\\nthe reason so long as we fight; but I want to understand.’‘A very laudable wish, sergeant,’ said a friendly voice from behind, and\\r\\nturning they saw Cornet Leland, cigar in hand, among them. The men would\\r\\nhave jumped up, but the cornet bade them keep seated.‘Would you mind telling us, sir, what we are going to fight about?’\\r\\nsaid Linham. ‘I suppose there is a cause.’‘I suppose there is,’ laughed Leland; ‘but it’s a very involved one. My\\r\\nuncle has deeply studied the question, and he tells me we have been\\r\\npartly led into this affair by the French Emperor, who is compelled to\\r\\nmake war on somebody to prevent his country from dwelling on awkward\\r\\nquestions at home.’‘Just what I should have expected,’ growled Linham; ‘we’re the cat’s-paw\\r\\nto get the chestnuts out of the fire as usual.{87}’‘There may be some truth in that,’ said the young officer; ‘but, of\\r\\ncourse, there are other causes. The Czar of Russia is practically a\\r\\nfanatic, with a raging hatred of Moslems; this he makes a pretext for\\r\\nwishing to take Constantinople under his protection. The other nations\\r\\ncannot agree to this, especially we who govern millions of Moslems in\\r\\nIndia. The Czar has poured an army into Turkey, and we are going either\\r\\nto drive it out or defend the country against fresh inroads, and the\\r\\nFrench are going to help us.’‘H’m!’ said Sergeant Linham; ‘seems rather a muddled-up affair to start\\r\\nwith; who knows what it’ll be in six months’ time?’The voyage was fairly uneventful. Jack was greatly struck with the\\r\\nappearance of Gibraltar, and he caught a glimpse of Malta. In the\\r\\nMediterranean bad weather was experienced, and after passing the\\r\\nDardanelles on the 19th of May the Eveline arrived off Constantinople.\\r\\nThe men cheered loudly as they caught their first glimpse of the\\r\\nenchanting-looking city of mosques and minarets. They proceeded to\\r\\nKulali, and there they disembarked and went under canvas. The troops\\r\\narrived, and the regiment was all together again, having lost only\\r\\ntwenty-six horses during the passage. On the last day of May they were\\r\\nmarched off to Scutari and inspected by his Imperial Majesty the Sultan\\r\\nof Turkey, accompanied by a large and glittering staff.Tired with a long day in the saddle, under a broil{88}ing sun, Jack was\\r\\npreparing to turn in when he saw Will looking for him.‘We’re to embark at once for Varna and join the troops there. We shall\\r\\nbe in the thick of it soon, or my name’s not Hodson.’‘And the sooner the better,’ said Jack; ‘there doesn’t seem to be much\\r\\ndoing here, and it’s hardly worth while coming a thousand or so miles to\\r\\nbe reviewed by an old effigy who hardly seems able to sit a horse.’Sergeant Linham had much to say about this second embarkation. ‘Seems to\\r\\nme we’re like a lot of blessed pilgrims wandering about to try and find\\r\\na resting-place,’ he said when they were again aboard. ‘Why the dickens\\r\\ndon’t we go somewhere and do something?’‘Not being a Field-Marshal or a Cabinet Minister, sergeant, I can’t tell\\r\\nyou,’ replied Jack as he gazed over the ship’s side.The sergeant snorted and walked off, and Jack gazed with admiration at\\r\\nthe magnificent scenery. The sea was a deep-blue, the coast-line much\\r\\nindented, showing light-green herbage, luxuriance of trees and flowers,\\r\\nand rounded hills in the background. As they steamed along the blue\\r\\nchannel of ever-varying width, they passed beautiful groupings of wood\\r\\nand dale, ravine and hillside, among which kiosks, bastions, tall\\r\\nmosques, noble mansions, and picturesque villages nestled.The waters abounded in fish, porpoises and dolphins plashing and playing\\r\\nround the vessel as she cleaved her way against the rapid flood.\\r\\nSword-fish occasion{89}ally made lightning-like raids at their prey, and\\r\\nhawks, kites, and sea-eagles flew skimming the surface of the water.Night set in before they reached the entrance of the Black Sea. As they\\r\\npassed the forts the sentries yelled out strange challenges and burned\\r\\nblue lights, which were answered from the vessel. Then they ran into a\\r\\ndrifting, clammy fog, which settled round them like a shroud and\\r\\nrendered everything as black as pitch, when, shivering after the heat of\\r\\nthe day, Jack sought his berth.In the morning the same haze hung over everything; but as the sun\\r\\nincreased in power it lifted and soon a line of land, marked by a band\\r\\nof white clouds, came in sight. As the atmosphere got clearer,\\r\\nundulating folds of greensward, rising one above the other, and behind\\r\\nthem hilly peaks, all covered with fine verdure, came in sight. The\\r\\ntransport rounded a promontory on the left, passed an earthen fort, and\\r\\nentered a semicircular bay about a mile and a half in length and a\\r\\ncouple of miles across, and there on its northern side lay Varna. It was\\r\\na fine-looking place, showing up well against the hills behind it, a\\r\\nblack-and-white coloured tower and the great lighthouse being the most\\r\\nconspicuous buildings.In the bay lay British and Turkish men-of-war and Bulgarian and Armenian\\r\\nvessels. Small boats by the hundred, mostly containing either jolly\\r\\nJack-tars or red-coated soldiers, darted here and there, and many and\\r\\ncheery were the salutations exchanged.The transport went on and dropped anchor at the pier, when Jack saw that\\r\\nthe town was surrounded by a stone wall ten feet high, painted white\\r\\nand{90} loopholed, and that there were some detached batteries mounting\\r\\nheavy guns.What had attracted his attention was a regular fleet of large,\\r\\nflat-bottomed boats, which were then approaching the transport. They\\r\\nwere manned by British tars and marines, and it soon became evident that\\r\\nthe boats were intended to disembark the cavalry. A rare job it was;\\r\\nbut, however, it was at last accomplished successfully, and the ‘Death\\r\\nor Glory Boys’ assembled together on Bulgarian soil.They were at once marched off to the British camp, which had been\\r\\npitched on a scrub-covered plain about a mile from the town and half a\\r\\nmile from a large fresh-water lake. As they proceeded they met\\r\\ndetachments of Riflemen, Highlanders, light infantry, Guards, and\\r\\nMarines; red-coats swarmed everywhere. Presently they passed a number of\\r\\nFrench soldiers, Zouaves, fine fellows in baggy red breeches, white\\r\\ngaiters, and tight-fitting blue jackets, swinging along with their\\r\\npeculiar gait.Jack’s was the first cavalry regiment to arrive, and as the Frenchmen\\r\\ncritically surveyed the smart blue and white uniforms, the fluttering\\r\\nlance-pennons, and other gay trappings, they burst out into a kind of\\r\\nyell, which the light cavalrymen, taking to be a compliment, answered\\r\\nwith a cheer.‘If that noise is the best thing the “mounseers” can do in the shape of\\r\\na cheer,’ growled Sergeant Linham, glaring at the voluble Frenchmen from\\r\\nunder the peak of his lance-cap, ‘I don’t think much of it.{91}’English staff-officers were seen in their plain uniforms galloping here\\r\\nand there, besides dozens of French officers in brass helmets or showy\\r\\nbusbies, glittering with a profusion of gold and silver lace, and\\r\\nputting the British quite in the shade.They also saw groups of lazy, indolent Turks, bands of villainous,\\r\\ncunning-looking Greeks, strings of Armenians, and an occasional\\r\\nBulgarian driving an araba, handsome fellows, in black sheepskin caps,\\r\\nbaggy breeches, and loose brown jackets, exposing their sunburned\\r\\nchests. In the sash encircling the waist a yataghan or a pistol was\\r\\noften stuck; but for all that they had a dull, dejected look, born of\\r\\nlong and cruel oppression by the Turk.At last the camp, pitched on a dry, sandy table-land was reached. The\\r\\nartillery were on the right; the commissariat, surrounded by carts,\\r\\nflocks of sheep, and cattle, on the left; and the Rifles and infantry in\\r\\nthe centre.Jack’s regiment, after being marched and counter-marched for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, was located near the commissariat.‘Anyway, we’re close to the grub,’ cried Pearson, as he dismounted, ‘and\\r\\nthat’s a thing I highly approve of.{92}’The Greeks, Armenians, and others surrounding the camps were some of the\\r\\ngreatest rogues in the world; many, in fact, were no better than\\r\\nbrigands, who thought as little of taking a human life as they did of\\r\\nkilling a fowl, and who were already credited with the murder of several\\r\\nEnglish and French soldiers.This fact was brought home to Jack on the very first night of his\\r\\narrival. Everything had been hurry, bustle, scurry, and confusion. No\\r\\npreparations had been made for the cavalry, and the men were busy till\\r\\ndark fixing the horse-lines, pitching tents, and so on. Thoroughly tired\\r\\nwith a hard day, they turned in; but, not, alas! to sleep. The heat, the\\r\\ninsects, the flies (terrible buzzing, stinging pests), kept all awake\\r\\nfor some time. At last the different noises about the camp died down,\\r\\nand all that could be heard was the stamping of the horses as they\\r\\ntugged at their head-ropes, or the occasional challenge of a sentry.Jack and Pearson, with several others, occupied a tent next to one in\\r\\nwhich was Will and some of his troop. Jack had at last sunk into a\\r\\nfitful sleep,{93} when he was suddenly awakened by hearing several shots\\r\\nfired. Immediately he sat up just as another report rang out, and\\r\\nsomething whizzing past his head buried itself with a thud in the\\r\\ntent-pole. The sound sent a cold shiver through him, and he jumped to\\r\\nhis feet. The others in the tent also woke up.Pearson, being a very tall man, took a couple of strides after one of\\r\\nthe suspicious figures, trying to seize it, while he cried out, ‘You\\r\\nseem in a hurry, friend.’Hardly had the words escaped his lips when there was a flash, a loud\\r\\nreport, and another ball came whizzing past the heads of the Lancers.The momentary flash showed up a startling picture. Three brawny,\\r\\npicturesque-looking ruffians in baggy breeches and turbans, simply\\r\\nbristling with weapons, were seen rushing away.The Lancers started in pursuit, shouting, tripping over tent-ropes, and\\r\\ncolliding with men who, aroused by the hubbub, came tumbling out of\\r\\ntheir tents.{94} Jack, Sergeant Linham, Will, and Pearson kept together and\\r\\nheaded the chase among the white tents.The lines of the Lancers were right on the edge of the camp, and it was\\r\\nfeared that the three desperadoes would escape once they could get\\r\\noutside the lines of tents, for they would have little difficulty in\\r\\npassing the sentries. Presently the pursuers lost sight of the men\\r\\naltogether, and running to the outside line of tents they all halted,\\r\\nvexed with themselves for having lost their prey.They had become separated, Jack standing in the shadow of a tent just by\\r\\nthe horse-lines. Suddenly a man came gliding round the other side of the\\r\\ntent, and, crouching low, was making off in the darkness. Jack, though,\\r\\nsaw the glitter of steel, and in an instant he sprang forward and\\r\\nliterally leapt on to the man’s back.A sort of hissing snarl escaped the fellow, and jerking himself upright\\r\\nhe tried to free himself from Jack’s grasp. The latter, however, was not\\r\\nto be cast off so easily. Being behind his man, he twined his left arm\\r\\nround his neck, almost throttling him, while with his right hand he\\r\\nprevented the fellow from drawing one of the many weapons he carried. At\\r\\nthe same time he shouted loudly for help. The man fought and tore,\\r\\nrending Jack’s hands with his long, horny nails. At last, to prevent\\r\\nhimself from being stabbed, Jack had to release his hold with his left\\r\\narm and seize the man’s right wrist. Then they rocked to and fro for a\\r\\nfew moments, when both fell, Jack being underneath. His head struck the\\r\\nground sharply, and he relaxed his hold. His assailant whipped out a\\r\\nmurderous-looking knife, which he raised on high with the intention of\\r\\nplunging it into{95} the trumpeter’s heart. He felt with his left hand as\\r\\nthough seeking for the place to inflict the mortal wound when, just as\\r\\nit seemed that Jack’s last moment had come, a heavy footstep sounded, a\\r\\nbig figure dashed into sight, the ruffian received a crashing blow on\\r\\nthe temple from a British fist, and Pearson’s voice cried out, ‘We’ve\\r\\ngot one, boys; I’ll hang on to him, while you see what damage he’s\\r\\ndone.’‘Ha, hum! that’s just as well for this gentleman, then,’ said Linham,\\r\\nwho at that moment joined them and saw the man whom Pearson held.Jack related what had happened, being listened to by an ever-increasing\\r\\ncrowd, for the noise had roused a good many men from their slumbers.Lights were procured, and the man, who proved to be a truculent-looking\\r\\nGreek, was handed over to the provost-marshal.In the morning those who had been in the scuffle gave evidence before\\r\\nthe provost-marshal, and the prisoner was identified by some of the\\r\\ncamp-followers as a notorious brigand who for days had been hanging\\r\\nround the camp.It transpired that a private of the Connaught Rangers named Conolly had\\r\\non the day before been drinking in Varna with several Greeks. He was\\r\\nknown to have had considerable arrears of pay upon him. That night\\r\\nConolly’s comrades were aroused by hearing heavy groans. They found he\\r\\nhad been{96} stabbed to death, and a man was seen escaping from the tent.\\r\\nSeveral of the Rangers gave chase, but lost their man near the camp of\\r\\nthe Lancers. It was supposed that having escaped the most pressing\\r\\ndanger, to show their utter contempt for the watchfulness of the\\r\\nEnglish, out of mere bravado the Greeks had started firing their pistols\\r\\namong the tents. Nothing was decided, however, and the prisoner was put\\r\\nback for further inquiries.‘H’m!’ snorted Sergeant Linham, ‘I suppose the toad is going to be let\\r\\nhave another chance of slitting our throats. If it had been an officer\\r\\nwho had been killed, I want to know’——‘Hallo!’ said Jack; ‘listen; it’s the regimental call: “Death or Glory,\\r\\nDeath or Glory, Death or Glory Boys!” Trot march, chaps! we’re wanted.’This was the first time he had spoken to Jack since they had landed.\\r\\nJack wondered what on earth it had to do with him if he were late; but\\r\\nhe had no time to think it out, for the regiment was formed for\\r\\ninspection by the colonel. This lasted some time, and when they had\\r\\nreturned to camp Will Hodson sought Jack, and his face looked grave.Jack whistled. ‘By George!’ he said, ‘that’s unfortunate for me,’ and he\\r\\nrecollected Napper’s words.With a sinking heart Jack followed the sergeant into the presence of his\\r\\nstern old colonel. Napper and the regimental sergeant-major were\\r\\nstanding by him.‘What’s this I hear about you,’ he began angrily; ‘absent from the lines\\r\\nand late on parade this morning—our first day ashore? What is the\\r\\nmeaning of it?’Jack was utterly surprised at the colonel’s tone, thinking he must have\\r\\nknown where he had been. He did not learn till later that the colonel,\\r\\nfeeling ill, had been up at the hospital all night, and only rejoined\\r\\nhis regiment in the morning, not knowing that Jack had been mixed up in\\r\\nthe scrimmage with the Greek. Jack explained where he had been, and the\\r\\ncolonel was looking incredulously at him when Sergeant Linham came\\r\\nhurrying up and corroborated what Jack had said.The colonel then turned angrily to Napper. ‘What do you mean by telling\\r\\nsuch a trumped-up story?’ he cried angrily. ‘If this is the way in which\\r\\nyou are going to exercise your authority you won’t wear your stripes\\r\\nmany days. Go away.—And you, Blair, are dismissed. I have been\\r\\nmisinformed.{98}’But Jack made no reply. He was thinking that the feud between him and\\r\\nNapper was as keen as ever, and that now Napper had every opportunity of\\r\\nmaking his life miserable.{99}On the third morning after their arrival at Varna, while Jack was busy\\r\\ngrooming Dainty, Napper, the new gold chevrons on his arms, came up to\\r\\nJack, and with an ill-concealed grin of satisfaction said, ‘Trumpeter\\r\\nBlair, the horse you are grooming, D 27, is to be taken over to the\\r\\nlines of A Troop. My nag having died, I’m taking yours.’Jack’s face flamed scarlet, and an angry answer rose to his lips. But he\\r\\nknew that Napper was only waiting for him to be imprudent or to forget\\r\\nhimself in some other way to at once have him put under arrest for\\r\\ninsubordination, and so strict was the discipline of the day that severe\\r\\npunishment would surely follow. Therefore Jack curbed his temper and\\r\\nsaid, ‘By whose authority do you demand my horse?’Again the hot blood surged into Jack’s face; but he went on with the\\r\\ngrooming of the horse, while Napper stood by making remarks.‘It’s about time the nag was given to some one who’ll look after her,’\\r\\nhe said; ‘her back’s sore already. Sheer neglect.{100}’‘Don’t you? Well, you’ll get some, and you’ll get yourself into trouble\\r\\nif you give me any more back answers.’Jack bit his lip, and just then Sergeant Barrymore came by. Jack\\r\\nimmediately hailed him and told him what Napper had said.Sergeant Barrymore frowned. ‘But it’s quite out of order to take a horse\\r\\nfrom one troop to another,’ he said to Napper.‘I can’t help that,’ replied Napper impudently. ‘I must have a horse\\r\\nthat’s used to trumpet and bugle, and a good nag too, as I’m the\\r\\ncolonel’s orderly. I’ve got permission from the riding-master. Of\\r\\ncourse, if you can override his decision I’ve nothing more to say.’He went off, and Jack saw him talking to the captain of his troop, the\\r\\ntwo going off to find the riding-master. Presently Barrymore, his face\\r\\nwearing a look of annoyance, came striding back.‘I’m sorry, Blair,’ he said; ‘but it seems Corporal Napper has\\r\\nrepresented that yours is the only horse in the regiment up to the work\\r\\nhe wants it for. He’s made a special point of obtaining it, and the\\r\\nriding-master has consented. Captain Norreys went to see him; but having\\r\\ngiven his word the riding-master won’t alter it.’Jack could have cried with grief and vexation when he saw Napper take\\r\\nhold of Dainty’s headstall and lead her away. The horse, too, seemed to\\r\\nresent it, for she suddenly bared her teeth and made a grab at Napper’s\\r\\narm. He, however, dodged back and gave the mare a sharp blow across her\\r\\nvelvet muzzle with the back of his hand.‘I’ll cure you of biting, you brute,’ he said as he tugged savagely at\\r\\nher headstall, and Jack walked away, for he feared if he saw any more he\\r\\nshould throw caution to the winds and give Napper the thrashing he\\r\\ndeserved.That night more transports arrived, having another cavalry regiment\\r\\naboard, and the first thing in the morning their disembarkation was\\r\\ncommenced.As the first troop, having got all their horses and baggage ashore,\\r\\nmarched up towards the camp, Jack saw the regiment was one of Hussars,\\r\\nand as they were passing him he heard his name shouted out, ‘Blair,\\r\\nBlair, shure it’s the bhoy himself;’ and, looking up at the trumpeter\\r\\nwho rode behind the officer leading the troop, Jack saw the roguish eye\\r\\nand laughing features of Larry O’Callaghan.‘You can always reckon that the ould 8th are where there’s work to be\\r\\ndone,’ said Larry. ‘Come and hunt me up when ye’ve a minute, and tell us\\r\\nall about this land of haythens.’Directly Jack was free he went over to the Hussars’ lines. ‘And how are\\r\\nyou, Larry?’ he said, shaking the Irish trumpeter’s hand.{102}‘Never so happy in all me loife,’ replied Larry. ‘And how ‘a that little\\r\\nmare that jolly nearly cooked your pigs for you at Chobham?’The Hussar gave an angry exclamation. ‘Bad cess to that Napper; he ‘s a\\r\\nbaste,’ he cried. ‘But there, on active service ye need never be\\r\\nbothered for long with a man who bullies ye.’Larry looked round him cautiously. ‘I mane,’ he said, ‘that ye should\\r\\nhave heard some of the tales me ould grandfather used to tell of his\\r\\nfighting days in the Peninsula and then ye’d understand what I mane.’The men of the 8th fraternised jovially with the 17th, the most friendly\\r\\nrelations having always existed between them. The two regiments lay\\r\\nclose beside one another, and Larry came over in the evening to see\\r\\nJack. They were talking with Will Pearson and one or two others when\\r\\nSergeant Linham was seen approaching.‘Hallo!’ cried Larry, ‘here’s old Leather Face. Shure he’s got the\\r\\ndryest throat of any man I ever met in me life, and we’ve got one or two\\r\\nlong-necked ones in the 8th.—Good-evening, sargint.’Linham gave Larry a stony look; then, without answering him, said to\\r\\nthose of his own regiment, ‘Ha, hum! orders have just been issued that\\r\\nwe parade at seven in the morning to march inland to a fresh camp. If\\r\\nyou’ll take the tip of an old campaigner you’ll turn in and get a good\\r\\nnight. It may be a long time before you’ll have another chance.’At that moment the trumpets of the 8th were{103} heard ringing out for\\r\\nsergeant-majors to attend for orders.‘By the piper, I must be off,’ said Larry, starting towards his own\\r\\nlines. ‘If there’s going to be a move I hope the ould 8th will be in\\r\\nit.’At three o’clock next morning the tents of the Light Division were\\r\\nstruck, and after breakfast they started in marching order. The infantry\\r\\nconsisted of the 97th, 88th, and other line regiments—the 7th and 23rd\\r\\nFusiliers, and a battalion of Rifles. A battery of artillery accompanied\\r\\nthem.Jack was mounted on the horse of a private of his troop who had been\\r\\nleft behind in hospital. Napper, on Dainty, passed and repassed him,\\r\\nspurring the mare and riding her with a heavy hand on the curb. Jack bit\\r\\nhis lips hard and pretended to take no notice; but the trial was a\\r\\nbitter one.The march was through a splendidly wooded country, abounding in clear,\\r\\nsparkling streams, the verdure being of the richest and greenest. After\\r\\na march of about nine and a half miles they reached Aladyn, where the\\r\\ninfantry were left behind. The cavalry and artillery went on another\\r\\nnine miles, at first through a fertile but deserted country, eventually\\r\\npitching tents at Devna. After the fine country they had passed through\\r\\nit was a bare spot, situated on the banks of a muddy river, very little\\r\\ngrass for the horses, and no trees within a mile or two.‘Just like our blessed arrangements,’ said Will to Jack; ‘march half a\\r\\nday through a fine country to find a dust-hole like this.’The heat was almost unbearable. The flies were an absolute pest, as they\\r\\nalmost worried the horses to death, and in the day-time men had to be\\r\\nemployed{104} to do nothing else but keep frightening off the swarms which\\r\\nsettled on every part of the poor beasts.The commissariat arrangements were fearful; there was absolutely no\\r\\nsystem, and many a day all Jack could get to eat was one biscuit and\\r\\nfour ounces of half-raw pork, washed down with muddy water from the\\r\\nriver, and that when thousands of tons of provisions were lying at\\r\\nVarna, eighteen miles away. There was plenty of fruit to be obtained\\r\\ncheap from the villagers, who after a time began to swarm in the camp;\\r\\nand the wine of the country, a poisonous and highly intoxicating\\r\\ncompound, was plentiful and cheap. Every one was warned against the\\r\\nfruit and wine, as sickness and dysentery began to get prevalent; but\\r\\nmany men ignored these orders, with evil results, as will presently be\\r\\nseen.Napper did everything in his power to make Jack’s life miserable, and he\\r\\npretty nearly succeeded. He also took to drinking heavily of the native\\r\\nwine, and was often half-tipsy, though never sufficiently so to prevent\\r\\nhim carrying out his duty.One of the amusements of those in camp was bathing, and such was the\\r\\nterrific heat and the longing to get into the cool water that many who\\r\\ncould not swim ventured into the lake. Life was very monotonous. There\\r\\nwas little to do; men pined at the inactivity. Illness began to appear;\\r\\nat first sickness, then that dread scourge cholera, and death commenced\\r\\nits havoc, a havoc that was to exact a toll nearly ten times as heavy as\\r\\nthe enemy’s lead and steel.One evening Larry O’Callaghan, who spent much of his spare time with\\r\\nJack and Will, came bursting{105} into the former’s tent, where Will was\\r\\nwriting a letter.‘I say, bhoys,’ he cried, ‘I’ve got a grand idea. I’ve applied for a\\r\\nday’s leave, and I’m going up into the country to have a look round.\\r\\nWhat do ye say to joining me; we’ll all go together, and if we don’t\\r\\nraise a shpree that’ll bate a first-class wake my name’s not Larry.’Both Jack and Will entered into the idea, and applied for and obtained\\r\\nleave for the day after next.At seven o’clock in the morning they all met and started, little\\r\\ndreaming of the adventure which lay before them.{106}They skirted the hills, and then went for some distance through a plain\\r\\ncovered with corn. Reaching a wood, they entered, then crossed a small\\r\\nstream by a rough bridge, arriving at a village, situated on the side of\\r\\na hill. The cottages were all miserable-looking hovels made of mud and\\r\\nthatched with rushes, and the inhabitants were a spiritless-looking lot.Breakfast of goat’s flesh and milk was obtained, and then the three went\\r\\non again through beautiful wooded valleys and past some fine\\r\\nriver-scenery. The natives seemed to look upon the three young soldiers\\r\\nwith a certain amount of suspicion; but they continued their journey,\\r\\nand midday found them in a village of some importance, in which half a\\r\\ncompany of Turkish soldiers were quartered. All feeling hungry, Jack\\r\\nsuggested dinner, and they entered the house of one of the principal\\r\\nvillagers in the hope of getting something to eat. In this they were not\\r\\ndisappointed; but Jack noticed that their host, a fine-looking, oldish\\r\\nman, who carried a knife stuck in his{107} girdle, seemed half-afraid of his\\r\\nguests, and appeared in great trouble into the bargain.The boys remarked about the Bulgarian’s sad demeanour; and Jack, who\\r\\nspoke French fluently and had a smattering of German, said he would try\\r\\nhis host in both languages to see if he could discover the reason of his\\r\\ntrouble.To Jack’s questions in French the man answered, but with a large\\r\\nadmixture of Bulgarian words. By constant questioning and repetition,\\r\\nhowever, Jack learnt the trouble of their host. It appeared that early\\r\\nin the morning a band of Bashi-Bazouks, unscrupulous ruffians of all\\r\\nnationalities who had been enlisted by the Turks, had ridden up to the\\r\\nvillage, seized all they wanted, beaten the headman, insulted several of\\r\\nthe villagers, and then seized their host’s two sons and the daughter of\\r\\nanother villager, demanding a large ransom for their release. The\\r\\nvillagers being unable to pay, the Bashi-Bazouks had carried off their\\r\\nprisoners, and were then supposed to be in a wood some mile or two away.\\r\\nThe poor Bulgarian said that such outrages were often committed, and\\r\\nthat the Turkish soldiers, far from trying to prevent these deeds,\\r\\nwinked at them, if they did not indeed lend active assistance. Unless\\r\\nthe ransoms were paid the rule was for the captors to send in to the\\r\\nparents the hands, ears, or perhaps toes of their prisoners; and this\\r\\nfailing, their heads would be thrown into their houses at night, and the\\r\\nmarauders would move on to commit further depredations somewhere else.‘And these are the hounds we’re going to fight for!’ said Will. ‘Why, it\\r\\nmakes one’s blood boil to hear of such things!{108}’‘Begorra, bhoys, we ought to have a worrd or two to say in this matter,’\\r\\ncried Larry, jumping up. ‘Who’ll follow me to find out these skulking\\r\\ncowards?’ and drawing his sword, he flourished it round his head.They were starting to do so when a loud English voice outside was heard\\r\\nexclaiming, ‘Hi, Tom! let’s pull up here and see if we can get a drink;\\r\\nI’m parched.’They all ran to the door and saw a party of men of the 23rd Regiment and\\r\\nsome artillerymen who, also enjoying a day’s leave, had wandered as far\\r\\nas the village.Jack soon explained to the sergeant of the 23rd what had happened, and\\r\\nthe little Welshman’s face grew red.‘Py St David!’ he said, ‘Englishmans, are we going to stand this? The\\r\\nRoyal Welsh Fusiliers will soon put this to rights, I shall tell you;’\\r\\nand he said a few rapid words in Welsh to his men, when those of the\\r\\n23rd who were his countrymen gave a loud yell.‘Ye needna mak’ sic a screech,’ said a brawny Scotch artilleryman; ‘but\\r\\nif ye’ll gi’e me a drink and show me whaur these reevin’ deevils ha’\\r\\nhidden theirsels, Andrew M’Farlane’ll see whether their heids are harder\\r\\nthan his fists;’ and he clenched a hand that would have felled an ox.{109}‘England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,’ cried Jack delightedly; ‘horse,\\r\\nfoot, and artillery. It’s a regular union army, and if we can’t bring a\\r\\ntroop of marauding cut-throats to book we’ve no right to call ourselves\\r\\nBritish soldiers.’Jack told the old Bulgarian what they intended doing, and he fell on his\\r\\nknees in gratitude. The new-comers were given drink and food, and then,\\r\\nunder the leadership of the little Welsh sergeant, and guided by the\\r\\nBulgarian, began their march.The wood in which the marauders had taken refuge was of great extent and\\r\\nvery dense, and the little party extended themselves and proceeded to\\r\\nbeat for their game. They soon found traces, and these they followed;\\r\\nbut it was getting dusk before they came in sight of some score of\\r\\nruffians lying sprawling about, mostly asleep, while two men stood as\\r\\nsentries over the three prisoners.The Welsh sergeant no sooner saw his enemy than he gave a wild yell and\\r\\ndashed upon them, sword-bayonet in hand. A couple of shots whistled\\r\\nabove the heads of the little party who went in after the sergeant. The\\r\\nBashi-Bazouks sprang to their feet, and seizing every description of\\r\\narms—rifles, pistols, swords, lances, yataghans, and knives—prepared\\r\\nto offer a stout resistance.The British soldiers closed with them, and soon a very babel of sounds\\r\\narose—yells, shrieks, the snap of pistols and clash of steel, together\\r\\nwith the fighting cries of half-a-dozen nationalities. The British,\\r\\nafter their long inactivity, seemed positively to revel in the fight,\\r\\nand M’Farlane, Larry, and the Welsh sergeant laid about them in high\\r\\nglee.While the British soldiers were fighting, the{110} Bulgarians crept round to\\r\\na spot where they had seen the prisoners tied to trees, and liberated\\r\\nthem. The Bashi-Bazouks, seeing this, and knowing they had nothing to\\r\\ngain by further fighting, soon made a rush for their horses, mounted,\\r\\nand rode off, firing their pistols as they went. A few flesh-wounds was\\r\\nall the damage done to the British, and in high jubilation they returned\\r\\nto the village.It was far too late to think of returning to camp that night, and so\\r\\nthey slept at the grateful Bulgarian’s house. Next morning, after a good\\r\\nmeal had been given the soldiers, the elders of the village and the\\r\\nrescued prisoners thanked them very heartily for their services, and\\r\\nthen, laden with presents, they started for their camp. This they duly\\r\\nreached without further adventure, and immediately went to their\\r\\nrespective regiments to report themselves and account for their absence.Jack and Will met Sergeant Linham as they were crossing their own lines,\\r\\nand that worthy looked sternly at them.‘Ha, hum, you toads!’ he said, ‘where have you been? Corporal Napper\\r\\ngave information that you had deserted, and an order for your arrest is\\r\\nout.’‘And if it isn’t desertion it’s absence without leave,’ said a\\r\\ndisagreeable voice; and, turning, the trumpeters saw Corporal Napper\\r\\nregarding them evilly. ‘They’re to be put under arrest, sergeant,’ he\\r\\nsaid; and in two minutes Jack and Will found themselves prisoners,\\r\\ncharged with a grave crime.{111}‘It’s all that beast of a Napper’s doings,’ said Jack angrily. ‘I am\\r\\nrapidly coming to the conclusion that I shall have to go for him, even\\r\\nat the expense of getting a court-martial. His tyranny is more than I am\\r\\ngoing to put up with.’It was, indeed, Napper’s doings, and he had spread a report that both\\r\\nJack and Will had been heard to say they were sick of soldiering and\\r\\nwere going to take the first opportunity to bolt.It might have gone hard with both of them had it not been for Larry\\r\\nO’Callaghan, whose explanation of his absence had been at once accepted\\r\\nby his trumpet-major. In the afternoon he came over to the lines of the\\r\\nLancers to see his friends, when to his surprise he heard from Sergeant\\r\\nLinham that they were under arrest.‘By the howly piper!’ he cried, ‘’tis too bad. But I can upset that\\r\\nbaste of a Napper. Shure the man that gave him the shtripes should have\\r\\nput ’em on his back, not on his arm. Now, sargint darlin’, we’ll\\r\\nconfound ’em. We’ll find the other bhoys as was{112} with us, and that’ll be\\r\\nenough evidence to upset even the great Dook himself if he was alive.’He and Sergeant Linham set out for the camp of the Royal Welsh\\r\\nFusiliers. There they soon found the little sergeant, who greeted Larry\\r\\nwarmly.‘You are a goot lad,’ he cried, ‘and, for a horse-soldier, fought quite\\r\\npravely. You would almost do for a Fusilier.’‘Shure now, you’re jokin’,’ said Larry, tipping a wink at Sergeant\\r\\nLinham; ‘I’d never be able to grow feet big enough.’The sergeant might have made some fiery answer; but his major, who came\\r\\nup at the moment, stopped all further exchange of pleasantries by saying\\r\\nthat he would himself bring over the sergeant and the other men of his\\r\\nregiment in the morning.Sergeant Linham and Larry, after dropping in at the canteens of various\\r\\nregiments, found Andrew M’Farlane and the other artillerymen, and all\\r\\nwas ready for the morning.When Jack and Will came up in due course before the colonel, the major\\r\\nof the Fusiliers, who had arrived with his men and the artillerymen,\\r\\nbegged to be allowed to say a few words, and the tale he told was such\\r\\nthat it at once altered the aspect of affairs.The two trumpeters were liberated, the colonel saying they had behaved\\r\\nas he hoped men of his regiment always would, by taking the part of the\\r\\nweaker against the stronger.This Jack could not pretend to be sorry for, though, as he said to Will,\\r\\n‘I would rather he had kept his{113} stripes and been made to give up\\r\\nDainty; the poor mare is only a shadow of what she used to be.’Next morning Will was put in orders as corporal and orderly to the\\r\\ncolonel, vice Samuel Napper reduced, and Jack hastened off to\\r\\ncongratulate his friend.‘It’s the first step up the ladder,’ he said, ‘and no one deserves it\\r\\nbetter than you; before we get home you’ll be sergeant.’‘If ever we do get home,’ said Will. ‘Last night there was a case of\\r\\ncholera in ours; Jenkins of C Troop died.’During the days that followed, the dread scourge, cholera, raged in the\\r\\ncamp; day after day the burying-parties were busy, and dozens died off.\\r\\nThe heat was intolerable, the camp a regular hotbed of pestilence. The\\r\\nwater was full of animalcules, and it was learnt that seven thousand\\r\\nRussians who had perished of cholera in the campaign of 1828 were buried\\r\\nin the vicinity of the British camp, the spot having been christened by\\r\\nthe Muscovites ‘The Valley of the Plague.’Many of the men took to drinking heavily, thinking thus to keep off\\r\\ncholera; alas! they only lessened their chances of avoiding it.Napper continued to drink as before, and since his reduction he seemed\\r\\nto hate Jack more and more. One morning, at watering-parade, he and Jack\\r\\nbeing together and some distance from the others, the former, who was of\\r\\ncourse mounted on Dainty, could not get her down to the water. He\\r\\ndismounted and dragged angrily at her headstall; but the mare still{114}\\r\\nrefused to drink. Napper then kicked her twice, savagely, which so\\r\\nenraged Jack that he cried out, ‘Let her alone, you brute, or I’ll\\r\\nreport you.’‘I’ll treat you the same if you interfere with me,’ said Napper\\r\\nfuriously, and he struck the mare on the muzzle, and was again about to\\r\\nkick her when Jack slipped from his own horse, and catching Napper by\\r\\nthe collar of his jacket, hurled him on his back.Napper arose, literally livid with rage. For a moment he could not\\r\\nspeak; then with eyes blazing with rage he hissed, ‘John Blair, I hate\\r\\nyou; you’ve been my curse ever since you joined. The same regiment isn’t\\r\\nbig enough for us. You got me broke. I’ll have your life.’‘To-night, then, with pistols. Over against the cemetery. Bring two\\r\\ncharges, and we’ll fight till one of us falls. We’ll end this.’‘I’m not mad, and you shall fight or I’ll brand you as a coward all over\\r\\nthe camp. The French duel, and so can we. You shall meet me, or in the\\r\\nfirst engagement we’re in I’ll put a bullet in your back!’Jack was left standing, lost in amazement. A duel! The thing was unheard\\r\\nof! Yet to be branded{115} as a coward, and to know that Napper was always\\r\\non the lookout to take his life should they ever be engaged with the\\r\\nenemy! Truly he was in an awkward dilemma.That day his troop went out on a reconnaissance, but Napper was never\\r\\nabsent from Jack’s thoughts for an instant. He thought and thought, and\\r\\nat last determined on a course. He would meet Napper, whose mind he\\r\\nfully believed was unhinged; but he would not fire. If he should fall\\r\\nhis death would be at Napper’s door, and he left a higher Power to\\r\\navenge him.Full of this thought, he was riding back in the evening, tired out with\\r\\na long day in the saddle. As they neared the camp a burying-party of his\\r\\nregiment was coming out. The sight was now, alas! too common to excite\\r\\nmore than a passing interest. Cornet Leland halted the troop, and they\\r\\n‘carried lances’ as the party went by.‘Wonder who it is this time?’ said Pearson to Jack; but the latter did\\r\\nnot answer, he was busily thinking of his mad meeting with Napper.He was coming from the horse-lines to his tent when he met Will, whom he\\r\\ndetermined to tell what he was going to do.‘Good heavens, man!’ said Will when he heard; ‘what a strange thing. The\\r\\nhand of God is indeed evident.’‘That Napper was taken with cholera at ten o’clock this morning, and\\r\\ndied at three. You must have passed his funeral as you marched in.’Discipline became slack, the men grew beards and moustaches, dress\\r\\nregulations were relaxed, and wonder of wonders, the men were actually\\r\\nallowed to leave off their stocks!The 11th Hussars, fresh from England, arrived to take up their quarters\\r\\nat Devna, and a very handsome show they made in their crimson overalls\\r\\nand richly laced pelisses; for those were the days before false economy\\r\\nhad been introduced into the army and the soldier’s dress shorn of its\\r\\nchief attractions.In the camp the distant boom of big guns besieging Silistria could be\\r\\nheard, and for three days a more heavy cannonade than usual was\\r\\nmaintained. On the fourth day it absolutely ceased, and it was feared\\r\\nthe gallant garrison who had made such a heroic defence had been\\r\\novercome; but later the news was spread that the siege had been raised,\\r\\nand that the Russians were in full retreat, although the gallant young\\r\\nEnglish officer who had been the heart and soul of the defence had met a\\r\\nsoldier’s death in the trenches.{117}After their defeat the Russians had retreated so precipitately that\\r\\ntheir route could not be ascertained, and orders were received from Lord\\r\\nRaglan that Lord Cardigan should at once pursue them. The news reached\\r\\nDevna at two in the morning, and reveille was at once sounded.‘Now, boys,’ said Sergeant Linham to Jack and Will, as he passed them,\\r\\n‘we’ve got work before us, so sharpen your swords and be ready to parade\\r\\nat four A.M.’Full of glee at the prospect of a change from dismal Devna, and at a\\r\\nchance of at last coming face to face with a real enemy, the trumpeters\\r\\nwent off.Jack’s regiment, with the 8th and 11th Hussars, started that morning at\\r\\nfour; they carried no tents and bivouacked on the bare ground. For\\r\\nseventeen days and nights they scoured the banks of the Danube toward\\r\\nRustchuk and Silistria; but beyond putting to flight several bands of\\r\\nBashi-Bazouks, who had been at their old game of pillaging and ravaging,\\r\\nno sign of an enemy did they see, and they returned to Devna quite\\r\\ndisabled for service owing to the number of sore backs among the horses.After the death of Napper, Jack had succeeded in getting back Dainty,\\r\\nand owing to his excessive care she was in tolerably good condition on\\r\\nhis return.The ravages of cholera continued, and soon after the return of the\\r\\nreconnoitring party the ‘Death or Glory Boys’ could barely muster on\\r\\nparade two hundred lances out of the three hundred and sixty one who had\\r\\nleft England three months before.All sorts of rumours were current. Sometimes it{118} was said that the war\\r\\nhad been abandoned, and that the troops were to return to England\\r\\nwithout having struck a blow; sometimes it was said they were at once to\\r\\nproceed to Sebastopol. But still they stayed on at Devna, apparently\\r\\nforgotten, till one August day an aide-de-camp arrived from Lord Raglan,\\r\\nbearing orders for the cavalry and Light Division of infantry to return\\r\\nto Varna and embark, for whence no one seemed to know. No one, however,\\r\\ncared so long as they were going from Devna, and not one who gazed for\\r\\nthe last time on the rich meadows and wooded heights, the verdant\\r\\nhillsides and the dancing waters of lake and stream, but hoped in his\\r\\nheart he should never see them again.Varna was found much altered; the place was still packed with troops,\\r\\nboth French and British, though thousands had died. They had been buried\\r\\neverywhere. Limbs could be seen sticking up out of the sand, dead bodies\\r\\nrose from the bottom of the harbour and bobbed about in a hideous\\r\\nfashion, while the places which had been set apart as cemeteries were\\r\\nfull to overflowing.Many of the regiments were merely skeletons; the 5th Dragoon Guards had\\r\\nlost so many officers and men that for a time it was disregimented and\\r\\njoined with the 4th Dragoons. Still, a move was at hand, and all were\\r\\nhoping to see the last of Varna.Soon after Jack with his regiment returned to Varna a great fire broke\\r\\nout and raged for ten hours. A French spirit-shop had been set fire to\\r\\nby a Greek, and though the man had been cut down to the chin by a French\\r\\nofficer the mischief had been done, and in spite of great efforts half\\r\\nVarna was laid in ruins, immense quantities of stores being lost.{119}The preparations for the embarkation were pushed forward; hundreds of\\r\\ntransports filled the bay of Varna, and the fleet assembled there. The\\r\\nnarrow lanes of the town were constantly blocked with mules and carts on\\r\\ntheir way to the beach with luggage, while the whole day long\\r\\ndetachments of men were being marched down and embarked.At last all were on shipboard and ready; but then another delay occurred\\r\\nwhile waiting for the French. After two days, during which time many\\r\\nmore men died of cholera, the signal was given, and the huge armada\\r\\nstood out to sea. It was then known that their destination was\\r\\nSebastopol, and Jack’s heart beat high with hopes that they would at\\r\\nleast have one brush with the Russians.Very bad weather was experienced; but, after a rough voyage of nine\\r\\ndays, on a beautiful evening land was made and the anchors dropped. All\\r\\ncraned their necks to get their first sight of that Crimea on which was\\r\\nto be fought some of the mightiest fights of modern days. Low lying,\\r\\nsun-scorched plains were seen, among which farmhouses and what was taken\\r\\nto be cattle could be distinguished. Those regiments which had bands\\r\\nmade the bay echo with their music, and the trumpets of the cavalry\\r\\nadded to the martial sounds.Orders were given for the troops to disembark next morning, and Jack\\r\\nturned into his bunk feeling thankful that at last active work was\\r\\nbefore them.{120}Cornet Leland was gazing through his glass at the plains and marshes\\r\\nwhen he suddenly exclaimed, ‘By Jove! those are Cossacks, or I’m a\\r\\nDutchman.’Later in the day anchor was dropped in Kalamita Bay, christened\\r\\nafterwards by the men ‘Calamity Bay.’ The place of landing was a long\\r\\nstretch of shingly beach, a lake about a mile long lying some two\\r\\nhundred yards inland. The English called the place ‘Old Fort.’Next morning at daybreak disembarkation commenced. The infantry of the\\r\\nLight Division had the honour of landing first; and, as it was quite\\r\\npossible their landing might be opposed, they were prepared. Each man\\r\\nhad his blanket and greatcoat strapped to his back, a spare pair of\\r\\nboots and socks, three days’ rations, and fifty rounds of ammunition.As the soldiers came creeping down the ladders to{121} the boats, the jolly\\r\\ntars in the most solicitous fashion looked after and assisted them,\\r\\ntaking their rifles, helping them to remove their knapsacks, which were\\r\\nstowed away under the seats, and patting them on the back and telling\\r\\nthem not to be ‘afeerd of the waves!’ At last, on a signal from the\\r\\nflagship, the boats dashed for the shore. In an instant the sea was\\r\\nalive with launches, gigs, and cutters all racing as if for life.\\r\\nThundering cheers burst from those still left on board, who watched the\\r\\nscene with keen interest.The French had started at the same instant as the English, and it seemed\\r\\nto be a race between them. The French boats were, however, lighter and\\r\\ncarried fewer men, and it was seen that one shot ahead of the rest. She\\r\\nhad only about a dozen men aboard, and, manned by a powerful crew, she\\r\\nflew through the water and reached the shore first.A great cry of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ burst from the French, and Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore ground his teeth in rage.‘Confound those froggies!’ he cried savagely; ‘they want to be first in\\r\\neverything where they can make a bit of show; we shall see whether\\r\\nthey’re as anxious to be first at the cannon’s mouth.’Long before the French had hoisted their tricolour an English boatload\\r\\nof Fusiliers had landed, and the officer sprang ashore, waving his\\r\\nsword. The rest of his regiment followed and were at once formed up,\\r\\nwhen they advanced in skirmishing order.From then the men poured on the beach, which literally swarmed with\\r\\nred-coats, and presently the{122} turn of the cavalry and artillery came to\\r\\nland. The sailors were here of the utmost service with the guns and the\\r\\nrestive horses, and many accidents must have occurred had it not been\\r\\nfor their herculean efforts and extraordinary care.Jack’s troop was the first to get to land, and the men were immediately\\r\\nformed up and sent on as a support to Sir George Brown, who had pushed\\r\\nforward with a few Fusiliers and Riflemen to take possession of a ridge\\r\\nahead and to reconnoitre the country. Sir George, being mounted, got\\r\\nahead of the infantry, and with the exception of a sergeant and two men,\\r\\nwho had kept up with him, was quite alone.Cornet Leland hurried up his Lancers, and was about a hundred yards from\\r\\nthe General when suddenly a Russian officer and a patrol of Cossacks\\r\\nwere seen on the ridge ahead. They were only visible for a moment; then\\r\\nthey disappeared again behind the ridge.Cornet Leland had, however, seen them, and cried out, ‘The General will\\r\\nbe killed or captured! First two sections unsling lances and follow me!’The horses, cramped with the voyage, could not move very fast, and ere\\r\\nthey could reach the General, who was very short-sighted, the Cossacks\\r\\nwere seen swooping down on his flank to cut off his retreat.‘17th, follow me! Charge!’ cried Leland; and, wheeling his horse, he\\r\\nmade straight for the Cossacks.The sight of the English Lancers took the Russians by surprise, and, as\\r\\nthough by common consent, they reined in their shaggy ponies. The waving\\r\\npennons and flashing lance-points were too much for them, and they\\r\\nsuddenly wheeled and galloped madly away{123} towards Sebastopol, receiving\\r\\na few shots from the French skirmishers on their right as they passed\\r\\nthem.‘Bless my soul!’ he said in perfectly unconcerned tones; ‘lucky you were\\r\\nhere; my bad eyesight will get me into trouble some day. I really must\\r\\nwear glasses!’The rest of Jack’s troop came up, and then Sir George led them some\\r\\ndistance inland, Cornet Leland keeping his eyes well about him. On\\r\\nrounding a sort of promontory they came in sight of a road leading\\r\\ninland, and there, before their very eyes, was a long line of wagons,\\r\\ndriven by native drivers and escorted by a number of Cossacks.‘It’s the true spirit of the old Peninsula days,’ said Sir George; ‘go\\r\\nin, my boy, and win. Attack them from each side.’‘Form ranks from the right!’ he cried. ‘Sergeant Barrymore, take the\\r\\nright column; the left follow me! Trot march!{124}’In a very few seconds the two lines of Lancers were bearing down on the\\r\\nastonished Russians, who never dreamed that such a handful of men would\\r\\nhave the impudence to attack them. Before they had recovered from their\\r\\nsurprise the Lancers were close to them.Then those Cossacks who marched in rear of the wagons faced about,\\r\\nformed in double column, and prepared to receive their enemy. They fired\\r\\na sputtering volley; but the bullets flew wide, and only one man and two\\r\\nhorses were hit.‘Gallop!’ shouted Cornet Leland, waving his sword; and Jack, who was\\r\\njust behind him, wheeled his horse to the right so as to come abreast of\\r\\nhis officer.Williams, who was riding behind Sergeant Barrymore, did the same, and so\\r\\nthe front rank of four, two armed with swords, for Jack had drawn his,\\r\\nand two with lances, thundered down upon the Cossacks. Having fired\\r\\ntheir volley, these remained halted in a sort of confusion as though not\\r\\nknowing what to do. Many of them did not even take their lances from the\\r\\nrests, but sat staring at the advancing English. They had little time to\\r\\nconsider the situation further; the Lancers came crashing in amongst\\r\\nthem, unhorsing several and scattering the others. For a few moments\\r\\nthere was a mêlée of stabbing lances, whirling swords and plunging\\r\\nhorses.Cornet Leland had ridden straight at a red-faced, snub-nosed officer,\\r\\nthe red cord on whose coarse green uniform was edged with gold lace; but\\r\\nthe fellow reined aside from the officer and faced the trumpeter. He\\r\\nmade a point at Jack with his crooked sabre, but Jack parried the blade\\r\\nwith ease. In return he{125} delivered cut two with all his might; but to\\r\\nhis astonishment his blade, falling on the shoulder of the Russian, was\\r\\nturned aside by the coarse red cloth. The snub-nosed Cossack, with a\\r\\nsort of hissing grunt, then drew a pistol from his holster, and,\\r\\nlevelling it at Jack’s head, fired, missing him only by a\\r\\nhand’s-breadth. Next moment a Lancer behind Jack drove his lance through\\r\\nthe Russian’s arm, and the fight was ended.The two lines of Lancers galloped on along the sides of the wagons,\\r\\nslashing and thrusting at the Cossacks. These seemed paralysed by the\\r\\nvery audacity of the attack, and galloped off, pursued by the victorious\\r\\nLancers till Cornet Leland ordered Jack to sound the recall. Then the\\r\\nmen, puffed with their exertions, came trotting back.The wretched araba[1] drivers were on their knees begging for mercy,\\r\\nexpecting every moment to be pierced by the long lances. When they found\\r\\nthat they were kindly treated they grovelled on the ground, which spoke\\r\\nvolumes for the fashion in which the Russians had treated them.The total capture was forty-two wagons loaded with provisions; some\\r\\ndrawn by two horses, some by three or four. Sir George was delighted\\r\\nwith the capture, and the handful of Lancers returned in great spirits,\\r\\nbeing greeted with cheers from the troops who had already assembled on\\r\\nthe beach.No other cavalry had been landed; and, as Jack’s troop off-saddled,\\r\\nBarrymore said, ‘What did you think of your first skirmish, Jack?’‘I don’t think it would have been quite such fun for you, Jack,’ said\\r\\nPearson, who had overheard the remark, ‘if I hadn’t been just behind you\\r\\nand skewered that snub-nosed Cossack officer with my lance. I fancy if\\r\\nhe had got another cut in at you you would have lost the number of your\\r\\nmess to-night.’The sky had got very black and the wind moaned in fitful gusts. The men\\r\\nhad been landed without tents or baggage of any kind, and they had to\\r\\nbivouac on the bare ground. The rain fell in torrents, and in their thin\\r\\nuniforms the men were soon drenched to the skin. Besides which, the\\r\\nnight was wretchedly cold, with a wind that seemed to penetrate to the\\r\\nvery marrow of their bones. Grumbling was heard on all sides, mingled,\\r\\nalas! with the groans of poor fellows who, thoroughly ill and weakened\\r\\nfrom their long stay at the camps of Aladyn and Devna, grew rapidly\\r\\nworse during the exposure of that terrible night, and who ere long had\\r\\nmet that most inglorious of soldiers’ fates, death by disease.Jack tried several times to sleep; but each time he awoke, wet and\\r\\nshivering, to find himself lying in a pool of water. At last he got up\\r\\nand walked about, passing the remainder of the night nestling close to\\r\\nDainty, who was fully as uncomfortable as was her master.{127}A mournful procession of bearers carrying litters were making their way\\r\\ndown to the beach. On the litters, their faces covered with their\\r\\nblankets, were the poor fellows who had died of cholera, aggravated by\\r\\nexposure, during the night. They were to be taken out to sea for burial.In spite of the rough sea the disembarkation was proceeded with; but it\\r\\nwas not until the afternoon, when the violence of the storm had somewhat\\r\\nabated, that the rest of the cavalry and the artillery could be landed.The next day the whole of the cavalry went out on small reconnaissances;\\r\\nbut no signs of any enemy could be seen. The weather improved, and that\\r\\nnight, over their camp-fires, the men felt much more cheerful.Jack and Will were both engaged making coffee at a big fire, round which\\r\\nsome score of sun-tanned troopers were sitting or lying, when the\\r\\nregimental sergeant-major came up to them; and, seeing Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore, said the adjutant wanted him at once. He was not away long.{128}‘Boys,’ he said on his return, ‘our troop and A, with two troops of the\\r\\n8th and 11th, parade at three in the morning to feel our way towards the\\r\\nenemy and to bring in forage. See to your arms and saddlery, for we\\r\\nshall very likely find some work to do.’‘Hurrah!’ cried Will, ‘I shall get my chance of being under fire, Jack.\\r\\nI envy you the distinction of being first.’‘Hum!’ snorted Sergeant Linham, taking his well-used pipe from his\\r\\nmouth, ‘those who are most eager to get under fire are often most eager\\r\\nto get under cover. Don’t run after danger, youngster; before you see\\r\\nEngland again you’ll have had a bellyful, I dare say.’‘Well, I may funk it,’ said Will; ‘but if you see me trying to bolt,\\r\\nJack, put a bullet in my brain. Don’t let me disgrace the regiment.’Sergeant Barrymore interrupted them by saying, ‘What’s all this talk of\\r\\nbeing afraid? If you’re anything like Blair, Hodson, we shall have\\r\\nsomething to do to keep you back. He’s a regular firebrand is Jack.’At this there was a laugh, and Brandon, a well-educated young fellow,\\r\\nwho had been an actor before he enlisted, and who always had an apt\\r\\nquotation ready, said, ‘England, I love thee well!The men, after having finished their supper, lit their pipes, wrapped\\r\\nthemselves in their blankets, and slept soundly till the trumpets of the\\r\\ncavalry division, all too early, were heard ringing out the reveille. By\\r\\nthree o’clock the troops taking part in the reconnaissance were mounted\\r\\nand ready, and, the 8th Hussars leading, moved out of the camp. Both the\\r\\ncolonel and major of Jack’s regiment were ill, and the two troops were\\r\\ncommanded by Captain Norreys, a man who had seen much service.The advance was pretty slow till it began to get light, and then Captain\\r\\nNorreys eagerly scanned the country with his glasses. No sign of an\\r\\nenemy was to be seen, and the little column, less than a hundred and\\r\\nfifty in all, proceeded for some miles through a country almost\\r\\ndestitute of tree or shrub, till they reached some hillocks, which they\\r\\ncrossed and then entered a more fertile country. A halt was made for\\r\\nbreakfast; then the Hussars and Lancers divided up, and each under its\\r\\nown commander was instructed to gather what forage it could.Jack’s regiment went away to the extreme right and was successful in\\r\\nfinding plenty of forage, which was loaded on the horses. So plentiful\\r\\nwas the supply that first a large quantity of it was collected; then the\\r\\ndifferent troops were assembled, and one-half{130} the Hussars and Lancers\\r\\nloaded up and went back to camp, after a corporal and two men had been\\r\\npreviously despatched at a trot to ask for another two troops to come\\r\\nout and collect what remained. Captain Norreys, leaving a score of men\\r\\nto guard the forage left behind and to wait till their companions should\\r\\nreturn from the camp, then led the rest of his mixed force on an\\r\\nextended reconnaissance, being very anxious to see more of the country,\\r\\nand if possible to discover traces of the enemy.Once or twice a fur-capped Cossack, sitting hunched up on his shaggy\\r\\npony, the head of his lance glittering in the sun, was observed upon the\\r\\nheights in front; but at first sight of the gaily accoutred English\\r\\nlight-horsemen he vanished as if by magic.‘Why don’t the beggars stop and show a bold face?’ said Will to Jack,\\r\\nboth the trumpeters and Sergeant Linham being with Captain Norreys.They reached a good-sized village, around which were a number of cattle,\\r\\nand Captain Norreys halted his force and sought out the headman to open\\r\\nnegotiations for the purchase of the cattle, for fresh beef was much in\\r\\ndemand. The headman was one who never did things in a hurry, and who,\\r\\nmoreover, had heard that the Allies were actually paying, and paying\\r\\nwell too, for all they took. So he determined to make the most of his\\r\\nopportunity.Captain Norreys and the commander of the Hussars were invited into the\\r\\nheadman’s house to take tea while terms were discussed, and the men were\\r\\ntold{131} they could dismount and procure what food the villagers liked to\\r\\ngive them, but that they were to use no violence. Several men were\\r\\nordered to remain mounted and to keep a sharp lookout around to see they\\r\\nwere not surprised.Larry O’Callaghan, who was with the small party of the 8th Hussars, was\\r\\nleft with the mounted sentries to sound the alarm in case of necessity.Jack and Will, with Sergeant Linham and Private Pearson, dismounted,\\r\\nand, tying their horses to the trees in a small orchard, made for a\\r\\nfair-sized house in the hope of getting something to eat. The master, a\\r\\nshort, stout, disagreeable-looking Tartar, met them on the doorstep, and\\r\\nin very voluble language, of which of course not one of the four could\\r\\nunderstand a word, opposed their entrance.On this Sergeant Linham drew himself up to his full height, and twirling\\r\\nhis heavy moustache said, ‘Ha, hum! you ugly, snub-nosed, cross-eyed son\\r\\nof a gun, we’re British soldiers representing Queen Victoria. Stand\\r\\naside and allow us to enter, or we shall exercise the right of soldiers\\r\\nin an enemy’s country and help ourselves.’The grandiloquent fashion in which these words were uttered seemed to\\r\\nhave some effect upon the Tartar; possibly the sergeant’s piercing eyes\\r\\nand beak-like nose, together with the medals on his breast and the gold\\r\\nchevrons on his arms, had more, for the Tartar’s next words sounded less\\r\\nharsh. He did not, however, move from the door.The worthy sergeant, tapping the hilt of his sabre, continued, ‘You\\r\\nthieving old rogue, do you dare to stand there still, barring our\\r\\nprogress? Don’t you understand that by doing so you’re defying me, and{132}\\r\\nthrough me the whole army, and through the army Britain itself? You\\r\\nputty-faced rat, you’re dealing with a man who’s fought in two campaigns\\r\\nand knows the usages of war—ha, hum!’ and the sergeant gave a terrific\\r\\nsnort.The snort completely overcame the Tartar, who, bowing low, stood aside,\\r\\nand Sergeant Linham, carrying himself with the air of a general at\\r\\nleast, entered the house, while the other three followed behind, almost\\r\\nbursting themselves in their efforts to restrain their laughter.They went into a large, stone-flagged room, and Sergeant Linham,\\r\\npointing to the table, then made signs that he and his companions were\\r\\nhungry and that they wanted food. The man shook his head violently; but\\r\\nSergeant Linham was not to be denied.‘Look round the place, boys,’ he said, ‘and see if you can find any\\r\\nprog. We are willing to pay for it; but something to eat we must have.\\r\\nWe’re soldiers in the enemy’s country, and we’ve a right to what we can\\r\\nfind; at least we had in India, and what was good enough there is good\\r\\nenough here—ha, hum!’In a hen-roost behind the farm the two trumpeters found a lot of eggs,\\r\\nand these they promptly annexed. Pearson, who had joined them, noticed a\\r\\nlarge barn, and he suggested they should put their horses in there,\\r\\nwhich they proceeded to do. Then they went into the house with their\\r\\neggs, which Sergeant Linham made signs to the man that he should have\\r\\nfried. Some bacon was produced, and a sullen-looking Tartar maid set\\r\\nabout cooking the same. Coffee was made, and the meal was being rapidly\\r\\nprepared when{133} a tremendous uproar was heard outside, and a little,\\r\\nthin, horribly ugly woman, who was clearly the mistress of the house,\\r\\nbounced in. Her husband had seemed voluble, but he was as nothing\\r\\ncompared with his gentle spouse. She stormed, roared, jumped, shook her\\r\\nskinny fists in the faces of the Lancers, and finally attempted to\\r\\nsnatch the pan from the fire; but this Sergeant Linham positively\\r\\nrefused to let her do.He caught hold of her to prevent her, when she turned on him like a fury\\r\\nand scored his face with her nails.‘For Heaven’s sake, boys, take this she-demon away,’ he yelled; but the\\r\\nwoman held on, scratching and clawing and calling out apparently to her\\r\\nhusband to assist her. He, however, kept in the background, until the\\r\\nwoman, from sheer exhaustion, left off fighting and talking, and bounced\\r\\nout of the room.The sergeant’s dislike of women was well known, and the trumpeters could\\r\\nnot conceal their amusement at the scene, though they were sorry for\\r\\npoor Linham.‘The old toad, the old vixen,’ he grunted; ‘faugh, she was like a mad\\r\\nmonkey!’ He then advanced towards the master of the house, and said\\r\\nsolemnly, pointing towards the door, ‘Go, you candle-faced barbarian,\\r\\nand keep that iron-clawed virago away till we’ve fed, or by all the\\r\\nsaints in the Russian calendar I’ll cut off your ears,’ and he whipped\\r\\nout his sword as he spoke.The man fled, and, the food being then placed upon the table, the four\\r\\nsat down and ate a hearty meal. While they were eating, Jack noticed a\\r\\ncunning-eyed lad, in a sheep’s-wool hat and wearing an orange-{134}coloured\\r\\nsash, who came in and peeped at them and then slunk away. This boy went\\r\\noff to the stable, mounted a little pony, and trotted off towards the\\r\\nhills in the rear of the house. Meanwhile the Lancers, enjoying the good\\r\\ncheer, laughed and joked gaily.Sergeant Linham and Pearson then lit up their pipes and passed a\\r\\ncomfortable half-hour, while Jack and Will explored the house, seeing no\\r\\none about. The upper rooms were either bed or store rooms, and passing\\r\\none Jack heard voices talking in low tones.The trumpeters’ voices had probably been heard inside, for all was\\r\\nsilent till a footstep was heard crossing the room.‘Hist!’ said Jack, holding up one finger; ‘I’m a Dutchman if there\\r\\nwasn’t a spur attached to the heel of that boot. I distinctly heard a\\r\\njingle.’The door was slightly open, and Will, peeping through the crack between\\r\\nthe hinges, said, ‘There is a man in uniform in there; I can see him.’‘Slip off down and bring up the sergeant,’ said Jack, drawing his sword.\\r\\n‘I’ll see the beggar doesn’t escape.’In a few seconds Sergeant Linham, with Pearson, appeared, and without\\r\\nany hesitation they all entered the room.It seemed at first as if it were empty; at least, no one was to be seen.\\r\\nThen Jack perceived that a man was lying in bed, and a uniform and sword\\r\\nwere on a chair beside it. He gazed at the red hair, snub-nose, and pale\\r\\nface of the man in bed, and in a{135} way it seemed familiar. Will’s voice\\r\\nwas then heard from the window.‘Here’s the fellow I saw, he’s dropped out of the window;’ and, running\\r\\nover, they saw a man in a green uniform, embroidered with coarse\\r\\norange-coloured cord, running across the yard in front of the house as\\r\\nfast as his legs would carry him.‘No,’ said the sergeant; ‘let the miserable toad go, he’ll probably be\\r\\ncaptured by some of our fellows.’They all turned to the bed, and saw the occupant thereof had reached his\\r\\nsword and drawn it, as if he feared some violence from the British\\r\\nsoldiers.‘You poor, deluded Russian monkey,’ said Linham in grandiloquent tones,\\r\\n‘don’t you understand the laws of civilised warfare better than to think\\r\\nwe should hurt a wounded man, for I judge by your face you are wounded?\\r\\nYou must be an ignorant beast not to know us English better—ha, hum!’The Russian seemed to construe these words into a sort of threat, for he\\r\\nmade a point with his sword, of which the sergeant, disapproving of such\\r\\nconduct, promptly deprived him. In so doing he saw the man’s shoulder\\r\\nand chest were bound in a bandage, confirming his suspicion that he was\\r\\nwounded.Jack, who had been looking at the uniform on the chair, suddenly\\r\\nexclaimed, ‘It’s the very dress worn by those fellows who were escorting\\r\\nthe convoy we took just after we landed.’‘That’s it,’ cried Pearson; ‘I thought I knew that squab face. Why, this\\r\\nis the chap who tried to blow your brains out, and whom I ran through.{136}’The Lancers and the Russian stared at one another, and it was clear the\\r\\nrecognition was mutual. The wounded Cossack captain, for that was his\\r\\nrank, scowled most evilly at the four soldiers, and there was fear, too,\\r\\nin his eyes, for he clearly expected to be either dragged off a prisoner\\r\\nor killed on the spot.At that moment the lady of the house bounced into the room, and in very\\r\\nhigh, piercing tones, gesticulating madly all the while, attacked the\\r\\nLancers.‘For Heaven’s sake let us clear out of this,’ said Linham; ‘that old\\r\\nbeldam would drive a stone image mad.’They all made for the kitchen just as the cunning-eyed lad, whom Jack\\r\\nhad noticed before, re-entered.They ran to the barn, and were all busy tightening girths when the door\\r\\nwas banged-to behind them and the key turned in the lock. In the\\r\\nsemi-darkness they threw themselves against the door. No good, it held\\r\\nfast.In a few minutes they desisted, when they heard a sputtering volley,\\r\\nreplied to by a sharper one. A ringing cheer, undeniably British,\\r\\nfollowed; then a clatter of hoofs, a chorus of cries, and all was quiet\\r\\nagain. Some little time passed in anxious uncertainty.‘I wish I had my hands on the rogue who locked us in,’ cried Will\\r\\nsavagely, battering upon the door.‘Don’t do that!’ said the sergeant sharply. ‘We’re in rather a tight\\r\\nfix, and we shall have to be very careful how we act. I take command,\\r\\nand no man moves except by my orders.’The ring of authority in the sergeant’s voice was unmistakable. Though\\r\\nthe trumpeters made fun of him, he was yet known as a brave soldier and\\r\\none who had seen much war-service; therefore, apart from the right which\\r\\nhis rank conveyed, all were ready to yield him unquestioning obedience.The interior of the place was examined; it was well and solidly built,\\r\\npartly of bricks, partly of timber. The door fitted well and was\\r\\nsecurely fastened. There was a small window perched high up, and several\\r\\nplaces that would serve well either as peep or loopholes. In the door,\\r\\njust above the lock,{138} was a round hole, cut so that any one on the\\r\\noutside could put his hand through and raise the latch on the inside.Sergeant Linham took up his position at the little window, the others at\\r\\nvarious peep-holes, all on the alert. They had not long to wait. The\\r\\nsly-looking boy with the orange-coloured sash came cautiously creeping\\r\\ninto the yard, followed by about twenty dismounted Cossacks and some\\r\\nHussars wearing the same green-and-orange uniform as the man who had\\r\\nescaped from the wounded Cossack captain’s room. The Russians all\\r\\ncarried carbines, and appeared to be waiting a signal to open fire.‘Boys,’ said Sergeant Linham, ‘have your pistols ready. Remember the\\r\\nmotto of the regiment, “Death or Glory!” These fellows may have our dead\\r\\nbodies; they mustn’t have our live ones. Ha, hum!’The Russians with their carbines fired a few volleys at the door, the\\r\\nbullets coming through it. Then one fellow advanced with the key of the\\r\\nbarn in his hand, his comrades, having drawn their swords, coming close\\r\\nbehind him as though they intended rushing in as soon as the door was\\r\\nopened and slaying all within.The trumpeters placed the muzzles of their pistols through chinks in the\\r\\nwalls. Pearson aimed through the hole in the door. Sergeant Linham\\r\\nallowed the Russians to get quite close; then he said calmly, ‘Fire!’Four reports rang out, and when the smoke had cleared off the Lancers\\r\\nsaw the Russians dragging away three wounded comrades. In another\\r\\nminute{139} they made a second attempt. Four more reports, and then a second\\r\\nretreat took place.‘They will unlock the door in a few minutes,’ said the sergeant. ‘I\\r\\nobserved that there were two staples and a cross-bar inside. Let us put\\r\\nthat up; it will keep them out a bit longer.’This was done, and then returning to their positions the four saw that\\r\\nthe men outside had been reinforced till they numbered quite fifty.\\r\\nThese, pushed on from behind by an officer, rushed up to the door, which\\r\\nthey unlocked and tried to throw open. The beam prevented them, when\\r\\nwith their sword-hilts and carbines they hammered on the wood.Then Pearson, seized with an idea, took up his lance, and, rolling the\\r\\nflag round the shaft, placed the point through the hole in the door and\\r\\nlunged out twice with terrible effect. The screams of the two men he\\r\\nwounded, in ordinary times, would have made the blood of the defenders\\r\\nrun cold; but their fighting spirit was now aroused, and they gave a\\r\\nwild hurrah.‘Well done, boys,’ cried the sergeant; ‘they’ve got a bit more than they\\r\\ncan stomach I think. I never heard of a foreigner yet who liked British\\r\\nsteel.’The Russians, in fact, fell back, having so far got much the worst of\\r\\nthe encounter. The four in the barn were wondering what would be the\\r\\nnext move, when the Russians again opened a sharp carbine-fire on the\\r\\nbarn. Many of the bullets penetrated and pinged uncomfortably close to\\r\\nthe Lancers.‘Throw yourselves on the ground,’ said Sergeant Linham; and there they\\r\\nremained until the firing was over. They then returned to their posts,\\r\\nas{140} another attack on the door was made; but their four shots proving\\r\\nthey had not been killed or disabled, the Russians drew off out of\\r\\nsight. It grew dark, and for a long time the Lancers were silent. Then\\r\\nSergeant Linham burst into a grim chuckle.‘The toads! we’ve got them in a corner,’ he said; ‘they have no\\r\\nfield-piece, or they could blow the place to bits in ten minutes. Then\\r\\nthey might burn us out; but the wind is blowing towards the house, which\\r\\nwould most likely catch fire and burn their precious wounded captain.\\r\\nThey’re in a fix.’‘Sooner or later, though, they must have us if we remain here!’ cried\\r\\nJack. ‘If we could undo the door we might mount, charge out, and cut our\\r\\nway free.’Jack went to the door, and without any particular idea pushed his hand\\r\\nthrough the round hole. He gave an involuntary exclamation of joy. The\\r\\nkey was in the lock where the Russians had left it, though they had\\r\\nturned it before retreating. In an instant he had communicated the fact\\r\\nto his friends and their plans were laid. The horses were still saddled,\\r\\nso girths were tightened and bits adjusted. Jack put through his hand\\r\\nand gently turned the key in the lock; the bar was then removed, and all\\r\\nfour mounted when the door was noiselessly opened, and they prepared to\\r\\ngallop out. Sergeant Linham and Pearson were to go first, Jack and Will\\r\\nlast.At a word from the sergeant they trotted out and had got to the gate of\\r\\nthe yard ere the noise of their escape was heard. Half-a-dozen\\r\\ndismounted Cossacks ran towards them. There was a shout, a sputtering{141}\\r\\nof shots, then the Lancers were galloping for life down the village\\r\\nstreet. A clump of mounted Hussars barred their way.‘Knee to knee, boys!’ cried Sergeant Linham. ‘Death or glory!’ and with\\r\\na crash the Lancers met the Russians.‘Hurrah for Old England!’ shouted Pearson, waving his lance, and they\\r\\ngalloped on, several shots being fired at them.Sergeant Linham got a ball through his lance-cap, another struck the\\r\\nshaft of Pearson’s lance; but on they went till they were clear of the\\r\\nvillage. When some distance from it Will’s horse suddenly sank to the\\r\\nground.‘Gallant friend,’ said Will,’ you’ve borne me well and done your best.\\r\\nHad you fallen in the village I should have been killed or captured.’There was nothing to be done, so Jack drew his pistol and put Will’s\\r\\nhorse out of its misery, after which Will mounted behind Jack, and,\\r\\nunpursued, they went on, guided by Sergeant Linham, who, old campaigner\\r\\nas he was, could tell his way by the stars.‘It can’t be our outlying pickets at this distance,{142}’ said the sergeant.\\r\\n‘Yet, I don’t know. Perhaps we’ve come farther than we think.’‘At any rate, we’d best advance cautiously,’ said Jack; ‘when we’re\\r\\nnearer we’ll go and reconnoitre.’They advanced as close as they thought wise; then they halted. They were\\r\\non rising ground, and on the road below them, which led through a\\r\\nvalley, men, and what looked like a long line of wagons, could be dimly\\r\\nseen; but in the darkness nothing could be distinguished for certain.‘Let Will and I creep forward and see who and what they are,’ said Jack;\\r\\n‘we’re lighter and smaller than you or Pearson, and can move more\\r\\neasily.’The sergeant demurred at first, but Jack pressed his point. He and Will\\r\\ndivested themselves of swords, spurs, caps, trumpets, and bugles; then,\\r\\nhaving nothing on them that would glitter or jingle, and armed only with\\r\\ntheir pistols, they started off.Quite noiselessly they moved forward until, as they got closer to the\\r\\ncamp-fires, they could distinctly make out figures in uniforms, clearly\\r\\nRussians by their caps, moving about between the fires. They advanced\\r\\nstill closer, and then they could see long lines of wagons—scores, nay,\\r\\nhundreds it seemed—drawn up beside the road. The native drivers were\\r\\nseated together in groups, eating their supper. It was clearly a convoy,\\r\\nand a large one too.In a couple of minutes they were on their way again, and Sergeant Linham\\r\\nguided them so truly that they went straight on until suddenly, from the\\r\\nshadow of some trees in front, two mounted figures appeared. Instantly\\r\\nthe cold moonbeams fell on the barrel of a carbine, and a stern voice\\r\\ncried, ‘Who goes there? Halt, or I fire.’‘Stand, friends, and give the countersign,’ came the sharp response, as\\r\\nthe carbines of the two Hussar vedettes were pointed straight at them.‘We don’t know the word. We’re four of the 17th Lancers left behind in\\r\\nthe village we halted at this afternoon.’‘Bedad, we don’t want no sargint,’ cried a rich voice; and Larry\\r\\nO’Callaghan came running forward. ‘It’s old Hooky-beak and my two chums\\r\\nof the 17th. I can see ’em.—The saints be praised, ye’ve cheated thim\\r\\ndivils of Russians, bhoys,’ he cried, ‘for I’ve been breaking me heart\\r\\nto think as ye was done for. Hurroo! come on!’ and in a few minutes the\\r\\nfour Lancers found themselves standing before a fire in one of the\\r\\ncottages of the deserted village in which the detachment had halted for\\r\\nthe night.{144}‘We were sitting on our horses, kaping our eyes and ears open,’ he said,\\r\\n‘when I happened to notice a pasty-faced young gossoon on a pony\\r\\nsneaking off towards the hills.’‘He had that same, and may the divil fly away wid him, for in about\\r\\nhalf-an-hour we suddintly saw him coming back wid a troop of Hussars and\\r\\nCossacks at his heels. Somehow they seemed to have got all round us. I\\r\\nsounded the alarm, and our fellows came tumbling out. In a jiffy they\\r\\nwere mounted and formed up. We answered the Rooshians blitherin’ fire\\r\\nwid a volley, and then charged ’em, going through ’em like a knife and\\r\\nbowling over a good number of the ugly bastes, wid a loss of only two of\\r\\nour men.’Linham and Barrymore presently came into the cottage, and after the\\r\\nlatter had congratulated Jack on his escape, he said, ‘This news about\\r\\nthe convoy is most important. Captain Norreys learnt something of it\\r\\nfrom a prisoner we took, and that is why we{145} remained here. Our captain\\r\\nwanted to go in search of it, but the captain of the 11th, who was\\r\\nsenior officer, would not agree. He, poor chap, has just died of the\\r\\ncholera, so Captain Norreys is now in command. Jimmy and I are going to\\r\\nwake him up and tell him what you’ve seen.’Captain Norreys was delighted with the news. ‘We ‘ll have that convoy,’\\r\\nhe said; and summoned all the officers at once to consult with him.Half-an-hour later, the little body of cavalry, picking up their\\r\\nvedettes as they went along, were on the move. Captain Norreys, having\\r\\nLinham with him as guide, led the way with his own troop; the Hussars\\r\\nfollowed. Silence was imposed on all; there was to be no talking or\\r\\nsmoking in the ranks, and on no account were any bugle-calls to be\\r\\nsounded.Progress, of course, was slow, and it was fully a couple of hours before\\r\\nword was passed along for the party to halt. Then part of the Lancers\\r\\nwere ordered to dismount. Leaving their lances behind, and taking only\\r\\ntheir pistols and swords, they then began to advance stealthily on foot,\\r\\nCaptain Norreys leading them. The other troops were for the present to\\r\\nremain halted.Jack and his companions were with the captain, and they went on and on;\\r\\nbut no sign of the convoy did they see.‘I hope we haven’t lost our way,’ whispered Cornet Leland to Jack. ‘It\\r\\nwould be a feather in our cap to take in a string of wagons. The cavalry\\r\\ndon’t get much chance, and the infantry are always sneering at us as\\r\\n“do-nothing popinjays.”’‘We’ll prove to them if ever we get the chance that a man in a laced\\r\\njacket can do as much as one in{146} a red coat, sir,’ replied Jack; and the\\r\\nday was not far distant when the prophecy was to be fulfilled by the\\r\\nimmortal ‘Six Hundred.’Presently they reached the road and marched silently along beside it\\r\\ntill there came a stern whisper for caution; then the thirty odd Lancers\\r\\nheard faintly on the still night air a rumble getting rapidly louder.Captain Norreys halted his party and said, ‘Take Sergeant Barrymore and\\r\\nhalf the men, Mr Leland, cross the road, advance about a hundred yards,\\r\\nand line the roadway. When the convoy comes in sight, wait till I have\\r\\ndelivered a volley, then let fly at them. Directly you’ve fired, run in\\r\\nand prevent the drivers getting off with the wagons; but do not hurt any\\r\\nof them if you can possibly avoid it. Disable only the escort.’‘Trumpeter,’ said the captain to Jack, ‘get off as fast as your legs\\r\\nwill carry you towards our main body. Directly you hear firing, sound\\r\\nthe regimental call and the rally. When the men arrive tell the officer\\r\\nin command of the Hussars to charge down on the convoy.’‘Right, sir,’ said Jack, saluting, bitterly disappointed that he was not\\r\\nto be allowed to ‘see the fun.’The sounds of wheels and trampling hoofs could now be distinguished, and\\r\\nJack went off. He judged he had gone some five hundred yards when, loath\\r\\nto go farther for fear he might not be able to take part in the capture,\\r\\nhe halted on the summit of a small eminence.The minutes went by slowly, and it seemed hours{147} to Jack, who was\\r\\nlistening intently to the increasing noise of wheels, before—Crash!\\r\\nrattle! bang! bang! bang! B-r-r-r-r—crash!—two volleys rang out.Tan-ta-rara! tan-ta-rara! tan-ta-rara-ra! rang out Jack’s trumpet in\\r\\nthe regimental call of the ‘Death or Glory Boys.’ Tum-ta-rara!\\r\\ntum-te-rara, tum-te! followed the rally.The sounds of conflict grew louder; over and over again Jack rang out\\r\\nhis calls. A thunder of horses’ hoofs sounded behind him.‘Hallo,’ thought Jack, ‘that can’t be our fellows yet.’ He turned just\\r\\nin time to see two mounted men galloping up the rise towards him. He\\r\\npaused for a moment, uncertain who the new-comers were. Then he saw the\\r\\nstumpy figures and levelled lance-points. Heavens, they were Cossacks!Jack let his bugle fall to his side; next moment he had his pistol in\\r\\nhis left hand and his sword in his right. Aiming blindly, he fired at\\r\\nthe two Russians. The foremost came to the ground, man and horse, with a\\r\\ncrash. For a moment the other drew rein; then, with a sort of grunt, he\\r\\ncharged.Jack dashed across his front, making the pony swerve, and, getting on\\r\\nthe Cossack’s left side, with a mighty sweep of his sword he cut him\\r\\nright out of his saddle.The first man, whose horse had been badly wounded, got to his feet and\\r\\nran off as fast as his legs would carry him.Jack sounded again, and in a few seconds the thud of hoofs and jingle of\\r\\naccoutrements fell on his ear as the rest of the little cavalry force\\r\\ncame up at a sharp pace.{148}The square-topped caps of his own corps and the flying pelisses of the\\r\\nHussars came in sight. Sir William Lennox pulled in his panting charger\\r\\nclose to Jack.‘What are these?’ asked the officer, pointing with his sword to the\\r\\nbodies of the man and horse on the ground.On foot Jack raced after them; but did not arrive till all opposition\\r\\nwas over and the convoy was captured.The drivers of the wagons seemed quite contented to be captured, and\\r\\nbefore the flying Russians were out of sight had signified to the\\r\\nEnglish their willingness to drive the convoy to the English camp.The wagons were counted, two hundred of them, laden with provisions for\\r\\nSebastopol. Besides which nearly three hundred head of cattle were in\\r\\nthe rear. A number of men were told off as escort, and the wagons headed\\r\\nfor the English camp.‘A glorious capture!’ cried Captain Norreys, wild with delight. ‘Lord\\r\\nRaglan will be pleased with this night’s work.’Captain Norreys remained behind as rear-guard with about sixty men,\\r\\namongst whom were Jack, Will, and Larry.{149}‘Bedad, this bates Donnybrook into a cocked hat,’ said Larry to Jack as\\r\\nhe rode by. ‘If the Rooshians would only stand their ground the Crimea\\r\\nwould be the finest place in the wurrld.’They had travelled some distance when, just as the sun was rising, Jack\\r\\nnoticed, topping a ridge on their left front, a whole forest of\\r\\nlance-heads.‘Form column of troops!’ cried that officer, and Lancers and Hussars\\r\\nswung forward to get between the Russians and the convoy.Carbines were loaded and swords loosened in their scabbards as fully\\r\\nfive hundred Cossacks and Hussars came sweeping over the crest.The enemy came on at a slow trot till they were about a hundred yards\\r\\ndistant, when the British delivered their fire.A score of Russian saddles were emptied; then Captain Norreys, well to\\r\\nthe front, drew his sword. ‘Forward men!’ he cried; ‘take your pace from\\r\\nme, and charge home!’At a gallop they rushed forward. Jack drew his sword and was in amongst\\r\\nthe foe only a horse’s length behind his captain. Lance and sabre went\\r\\nto work, and in thirty seconds the Russians were flying.‘No, no, sergeant; it may be a trap,’ said Captain Norreys. ‘Pick up\\r\\nthose three wounded men of ours and get them to the wagons.{150}’The Russians reformed and hung upon the rear of the column; but they\\r\\nseemed to have no stomach for further fighting.The remaining troops of the 11th Hussars, which had been sent out from\\r\\nthe English camp as reinforcements, came sweeping by, their sword-blades\\r\\nflashing in the sunlight. With a cheer they advanced towards the still\\r\\nvisible Russians, who turned and literally galloped away.That was the last seen of the enemy. The captured convoy got safely into\\r\\ncamp, the cavalrymen receiving a great ovation when they arrived.\\r\\nCaptain Norreys was duly thanked in orders; and in his report to Lord\\r\\nRaglan he made mention of Sergeant Linham’s defence of the barn, and\\r\\nJack’s part in bringing up the reserves and the gallant way in which he\\r\\nhad fought and defeated two Cossacks. But long before the report was\\r\\nwritten Jack was sound asleep, dreaming he was once more at home, taking\\r\\ntea with his mother and sisters in the little garden at Kew.{151}The whole army marched, baggage, ammunition, commissariat, and invalids.\\r\\nThere was no base to fall back on. If attacked, the column must fight\\r\\nand conquer; death or total surrender were the only alternatives. Lord\\r\\nRaglan was taking a grave and terrible risk; but he had no option.Jack’s colonel had to be left behind. He had struggled long against the\\r\\nravages made upon his constitution during their stay at Varna and Devna;\\r\\nbut he had at last to succumb, and the day after the army began its\\r\\nmarch he had to be sent on board and invalided to England.The loss of the colonel was a great blow to Linham, who in his grumbling\\r\\nway said more than once, ‘No good will come of a campaign begun so\\r\\nbadly.’The morning of the advance was a beautiful one. The sun shone hotly, but\\r\\nwas tempered by a cool sea-breeze. The ground over which the troops\\r\\nmoved was undulating and covered with a sweet-smelling herb which gave\\r\\noff a pleasing aroma as it was crushed under the feet and hoofs of the\\r\\nmarching thousands.The British army moved in such a formation that{152} it could array itself\\r\\nfor battle in a very few minutes, and it presented a magnificent sight\\r\\nto the beholder.Jack and his regiment marched in rear of the left flank, and on crossing\\r\\na slight ridge a splendid view of the whole army was obtained.On the extreme right was the sea, sparkling and dancing in the sunlight.\\r\\nRiding on its waters and advancing majestically, keeping just abreast of\\r\\nthe allied army, were the French and English fleets.Beside the shore marched the French divisions in column, their weapons\\r\\nsparkling and colours waving. Behind them came the Turks. On their left,\\r\\nin the post of danger, their front and flank open to attack, came the\\r\\nBritish army in battle array. The advance-guard was formed of the 11th\\r\\nHussars and 13th Light Dragoons, with an infantry battalion. A long line\\r\\nof nimble, green-clad Riflemen in skirmishing order followed. Four grand\\r\\ndivisions of scarlet-coated infantry, massed in close columns, with\\r\\ntheir accompanying batteries of artillery, formed the main body, the\\r\\nbaggage and cattle being in rear.On the left flank there was another line of skirmishers of the Rifles,\\r\\ntwo hundred yards from the main body; outside them again came the 8th\\r\\nHussars on the left front; the 17th, as already stated, on the left\\r\\nrear; while the 4th Light Dragoons formed the rear-guard.The sun sparkled on arms and accoutrements, colours waved in the air,\\r\\nuniforms of every colour met the eye as far as it would reach; the\\r\\nwhole, while the bands pealed forth their brazen music, forming such a\\r\\npicture of martial glory as few men are privileged to behold.{153}The march continued. Soon the bands ceased playing. Then stragglers\\r\\nbegan to fall out of the ranks. Poor fellows, worn with sickness and\\r\\nprivation, they were absolutely unable to stand the strain of a march of\\r\\na few miles.Many of Jack’s comrades tried to urge the stragglers to keep up. Alas!\\r\\nit was but too clearly evident by the blackened, swollen faces of many\\r\\nof those who fell out that they were in the last throes of cholera. They\\r\\nhad to be left where they fell, for nothing could be done for them.\\r\\nOthers of the stragglers fell out from sheer weakness and exhaustion,\\r\\nand these were told that the Cossacks would overtake and spear them did\\r\\nthey not keep up. Not a man, however, gave up until he could go no\\r\\nlonger, and then no threats were of any avail.The ground became littered with arms and accoutrements—bearskins,\\r\\nshakos, belts, knapsacks, and rifles; with that, and the figures of the\\r\\nmen who had fallen from the ranks, the country over which the troops had\\r\\npassed resembled a field on which a pitched battle had been fought. The\\r\\nspirits of the men drooped, their faces took on a dogged look; but their\\r\\nenthusiasm was gone. The glory of the morning was over.As the hours dragged on another terrible hardship afflicted the poor\\r\\nsoldiers. A maddening, burning thirst consumed them, yet not a drop of\\r\\nwater was to be had.Sergeant Linham, who had suffered all the horrors of thirst in India,\\r\\nchewed a bullet grimly. ‘It’s the first taste of real war the youngsters\\r\\nhave had,’ he said. ‘It isn’t the fighting—that’s nothing. It’s the\\r\\nstarving and marching, lying on the ground all{154} night in pouring rain or\\r\\nsnow, the freezing and the burning—that’s war. Fighting, pah! that’s\\r\\nthe only pleasant part of war.’The advance became slower, the numbers falling from the ranks larger,\\r\\ntill in the afternoon a great shout went up in front, and the column\\r\\nhalted.The advance-guard had reached the river Bulganak, their halting-place;\\r\\nand, heedless of discipline, the thirst-maddened soldiers rushed forward\\r\\nand buried their faces in the cool, clear waters running between\\r\\nfertile, grassy banks.The Hussars and Light Dragoons, who had formed the advance-guard, had,\\r\\nat the orders of Lord Raglan, crossed the river. Some of the enemy’s\\r\\ncavalry had been seen, and the commander-in-chief, determined to satisfy\\r\\nhimself that his army could rest in comparative safety, had gone forward\\r\\nwith the cavalry to reconnoitre the position.Jack’s regiment, having assuaged their thirst, ate part of the ration\\r\\nwhich had been served out to them; then flung themselves on the ground,\\r\\nunder the shadow of the trees, to enjoy a nap or a smoke.Bill Parkes laughed. ‘I remember the first time you ever put on a\\r\\nlance-cap,’ he said, ‘you thought you looked mighty fine.’Jack threw off the heaviest part of his accoutrements and seated himself\\r\\nwith his comrades. A group of officers sat just by them, and Jack could\\r\\nnot help being struck by the change the campaign had already made in\\r\\ntheir appearance. The gay uniforms, sodden with rain, stained with mud,\\r\\nand often torn, were tarnished and frayed. Their scabbards and spurs\\r\\nwere rusty, and their faces disfigured by beards of many days’ growth.\\r\\nWorse than all, however, was the fact that not one of them had enjoyed a\\r\\nchange of linen for a week, for every man had landed in what he stood up\\r\\nin and no more, even the pelisses of the 8th Hussars being left behind\\r\\non shipboard; nor did the regiment ever see them again, for they went\\r\\ndown in Balaclava harbour during the great storm of 14th November.As Jack was looking he observed a staff-officer gallop up to the little\\r\\ngroup. He spoke hurriedly for a few moments; then Major Willett,\\r\\ncommanding the 17th, jumping to his feet, looked over towards the\\r\\ntrumpeters, and beckoned to Jack. Seizing his bugle, Jack ran over,\\r\\nbuttoning up his jacket on the way.‘Goodness knows!’ replied Jack as he buckled on his sword and ran\\r\\ntowards Dainty; ‘but from the haste with which those Hussar officers are\\r\\nmaking for their own men it’s something pretty urgent, I should think.{156}’At that moment the trumpets of the 8th rang out, and in less than three\\r\\nminutes the two regiments were mounted. The Lancers leading, at a trot\\r\\nthey made for the bridge, across which they clattered just as the bugles\\r\\nof the infantry Light Division behind them were heard sounding the\\r\\nfall-in.The ground on the other side of the river rose in a succession of ridges\\r\\nright up to the heights looking down on the Bulganak. The Lancers\\r\\nrapidly mounted the first ridge, and as they did so Russian vedettes\\r\\nwere seen upon the heights in front. On mounting the second ridge a\\r\\ncurious sight met their gaze. On the level ground before them were the\\r\\n11th Hussars and 13th Light Dragoons drawn up in beautiful lines, their\\r\\nofficers in front, all sitting as perfectly still as though on parade at\\r\\nhome. Facing them, on the hill above, was a vast body of Russian horse,\\r\\nHussars, Dragoons, and Cossacks, some thousands strong. They were\\r\\nthrowing out skirmishers, who, as the Lancers came up, opened fire with\\r\\ntheir carbines but apparently did no damage. The British cavalry took no\\r\\nmore notice of being fired at than though the Russians had been blowing\\r\\npeas at them.On the northern side of the hollow sat Lord Raglan and his staff. The\\r\\n8th Hussars and 17th Lancers were ordered to form up in rear of the two\\r\\nregiments already in position, and this they did as quietly and orderly\\r\\nas though at Hounslow or Canterbury.The officers dressed the ranks. ‘Eyes left!’ ‘Up a little, Private\\r\\nJones!’ ‘Back, Thompson—rein back a little. That’s better. Halt! Eyes\\r\\nfront! Slope lances!’ And all this under a smart fire!The Russians began manœuvring, but seemed more{157} inclined to draw the\\r\\nBritish cavalry from their position than to charge down upon them.‘I wonder what we’re going to do?’ said Jack excitedly to Pearson. ‘Why\\r\\ndon’t they let us charge? The ground’s lovely, and I’ll bet we should\\r\\nroll those fellows up like fun.’‘We’d have a good try,’ said Pearson, biting his fair moustache in his\\r\\nexcitement as he fixed the chain of his headdress tightly on the point\\r\\nof his chin.After a little time the Light Division of infantry came marching into\\r\\nthe plain, their white-slashed scarlet coats making a brilliant patch of\\r\\ncolour. The infantry were formed into line behind the cavalry, and\\r\\npresently, at a smart trot, a nine-pounder battery came swinging along\\r\\nand took post on the right of the infantry, while a six-pounder battery\\r\\ntook ground beside the cavalry.Excitement rose to a high pitch amongst the British, who expected every\\r\\nmoment to hear the artillery open fire; but when the whole force had\\r\\nbeen posted a General came galloping up from Lord Raglan, and seemed to\\r\\nbe holding an animated discussion with Lord Lucan, commanding the\\r\\ncavalry. This lasted some time, and then Lord Lucan was seen to give an\\r\\norder to his brigadier, Lord Cardigan.‘The ball’s going to commence,’ said Pearson to Jack, ‘and we’ll teach\\r\\nthese Russians a new dance if I’m not much mistaken.’Words of command rang out in front, and the 11th Hussars were seen to be\\r\\non the move, but not towards{158} the enemy. By successive squadrons they\\r\\nmoved, slowly and ceremoniously, and reformed behind the supporting\\r\\nsquadrons, always leaving two squadrons facing the enemy. The Light\\r\\nDragoons followed suit, and it became evident that retreat was the order\\r\\nof the day. An exclamation of regret burst from the Lancers, which was\\r\\ninstantly repressed by the officers.No sooner, however, did the Russians see that the English cavalry was\\r\\nnot going to advance than a rapid movement began. Their squadrons opened\\r\\nright and left and wheeled away, when two batteries of artillery came\\r\\nbounding up to the top of the ridge facing the British, hurriedly\\r\\nunlimbered, and opened fire. At the same time clouds of Riflemen topped\\r\\nthe hills and began a hot fusillade.‘By George, we’re in for it, after all!’ said Jack to Pearson as a\\r\\nround-shot came whizzing over his head and struck the ground just behind\\r\\nhim.Mixed with the hum of round-shot came the vicious scream of shells, and\\r\\npresently one or two men and horses went down.All this while Jack’s regiment and the 8th were kept perfectly still,\\r\\nwhile the regiments which had been in their front retired by squadrons\\r\\nbehind them.The 11th Hussars were just wheeling by Jack’s troop when a shell came\\r\\nscreaming by and entered the body of a horse of the Hussars. It struck\\r\\nwith a sickening squelch and then exploded, a horrible heap on the\\r\\nground being all that remained of what a moment before had been a smart\\r\\ncavalryman. A second later a round-shot caught another Hussar on the\\r\\nfoot, which it carried clean away. The gallant{159} soldier glanced down and\\r\\nshifted himself in the saddle so as to retain his balance.‘It’s only my foot,’ he said calmly; ‘the doctor’ll soon put that\\r\\nright;’ and he went on with his squadron.Jack’s regiment was then in front, and round-shot and shell, to say\\r\\nnothing of musket-balls, began to whiz about them. The round-shot could\\r\\nbe distinctly seen coming, and the men ducked as though to avoid them,\\r\\nthough they often went twenty feet above their heads.‘Don’t duck, boys—don’t duck,’ said Sergeant Linham, who sat apparently\\r\\nquite unconcerned, looking about him. ‘If a shot’s coming for you no\\r\\namount of ducking will make it miss you, and in India it wasn’t\\r\\nconsidered the thing for men to bob about. Remember the motto of the\\r\\nregiment. Ha, hum!’‘Hallo!’ cried a dozen voices, ‘Benson’s down! he’s killed! No, he’s up!\\r\\nHallo, Fred! are you hurt?’‘Shook up a bit,’ said the Lancer in a dazed voice; ‘but the nag’s done\\r\\nfor, I’m afraid;’ and that was true, for the poor animal’s head had been\\r\\ncompletely smashed by the shot.The fire under which the cavalry still sat was getting very hot, when a\\r\\ntrumpet rang out and the six-pounder battery with them opened fire. This\\r\\nseemed, however, to have little effect; then the nine-pounder battery\\r\\nopened, and their shells were seen to be exploding among the Russian\\r\\ncavalry and doing much damage. Presently a shell struck the limber of\\r\\none of the Russian guns, which it exploded, just{160} as another shell\\r\\nstruck one of the guns, overturning it and killing several of the\\r\\ngunners.By that time Jack’s regiment was the only one under fire, being left as\\r\\na support to the nine-pounder battery.Suddenly a move was made by the Russians. Several squadrons of sky-blue\\r\\ncoated Hussars came rapidly down and made straight for the English guns.Hardly were the words out of his mouth than the orderly trumpeter\\r\\nsounded, and the regiment moved off at a trot to take ground on its\\r\\nright, so as to cover the threatened guns.The Russians, contrary to their usual rule, came on boldly, and it was\\r\\nsoon evident they meant to charge.Instantly the officer commanding the Lancers took in the situation. The\\r\\nRussians must be held in check or they would in a few minutes overtake\\r\\nthe slow-moving artillery. A few sharp orders were given; then the\\r\\nLancers advanced at a trot. At a hundred yards’ distance the pace was\\r\\nincreased, and Major Willett shouted, ‘Come on, boys! Charge!’Then, with knees well-pressed in, bodies eagerly bent forward, and\\r\\nlances levelled, the English squadrons rode down upon the enemy.With a crash they met the sky-blue Hussars, and for an instant they\\r\\nglared into one another’s faces. The Russians had a curiously set\\r\\nexpression on theirs as though of pain; but it was probably only intense\\r\\nexcitement. The Lancers had but little time to note their enemies’\\r\\nfaces, however. Heavier men and better mounted, the immense superiority\\r\\nof the lance over the sword in shock-tactics showed itself, and the{161}\\r\\nRussians were hurled back. The Lancers would have pursued; but at that\\r\\ninstant Captain Norreys saw a battalion of infantry marching down upon\\r\\nhis flank. At the same time the recall was being constantly sounded, so\\r\\nCaptain Norreys gave the word to his squadron.No sooner had they turned their backs to the enemy than the guns on the\\r\\nridge opened on them, and shells began to plump amongst them; several\\r\\ncasualties occurred, and Captain Norreys ground his teeth.‘I’d like to go in at those fellows,’ he cried, turning in his saddle\\r\\nand shaking his sword savagely at the guns; but the recall was still\\r\\nbeing sounded, and so he gave the word to his men to trot.Hardly had they started when two shells burst in amongst them, and Tommy\\r\\nGallon, who had been riding in the rear near his captain, was seen lying\\r\\non the ground. The squadron went on; but Jack, seeing his friend down,\\r\\ngalloped his horse towards him, and, though under a heavy fire of both\\r\\nartillery and musketry, dismounted and raised his friend’s head.For answer, poor Tom Gallon pointed to his left arm. It seemed to be\\r\\nsmashed. He had been struck by a splinter of shell, which had first\\r\\nkilled his horse, then smashed his left forearm.‘No, no; leave me, Jack,’ said the wounded trumpeter. ‘See, the troop is\\r\\nretreating, and, ah—look! the Russians are on us.’This was the case, for the Russian Hussars had hung on to the rear of\\r\\nthe Lancers. Seeing the{162} two trumpeters, several of them were trotting\\r\\nup, brandishing their swords.The Russians came circling round, making a curious hissing noise, some\\r\\nslashing at Jack, while others bent over in their saddles and tried to\\r\\nreach the wounded trumpeter with their points.But the Russians, supremely ignorant of what he said, continued their\\r\\nattack, Jack keeping them off by performing the moulinet with his sabre.\\r\\nHe felt himself slightly wounded once or twice; but he had determined to\\r\\nbe cut to pieces rather than desert his fellow-trumpeter.A very stout, dark-visaged Russian, getting behind Gallon, made a point\\r\\nwith his sword and thrust it into his back; and, hearing his comrade’s\\r\\nmoan, Jack, mad with fury, was just in time to see the coward withdraw\\r\\nhis weapon. Jack seized the Hussar’s bridle; but the fellow cut him down\\r\\nover the head, then spurred his horse and dragged Jack off his feet.\\r\\nAnother moment would have settled his fate for ever; but a thunder of\\r\\nhoofs sounded, and Pearson, returning to the rescue of the trumpeters,\\r\\ncaught the cowardly Russian just between the shoulder-blades with his\\r\\nlance and completely transfixed him. It was of no use trying to withdraw\\r\\nthe weapon, so the gallant trooper let go and drew his sword, with which\\r\\nhe cut another foe from his saddle.Williams, Brandon, and several others, seeing the danger of their\\r\\ncomrades, came galloping back, and the Russians immediately retired.\\r\\nJack and TomGallon were lifted up in strong arms and soon conveyed out of danger;\\r\\nbut Jack swooned from loss of blood on the way, nor did he recover till\\r\\nhe found himself lying on his back, his face and head wet, while\\r\\nsomebody held & water-bottle to his lips.{164}‘Yes, and is still alive, thanks to you. He is being attended to by the\\r\\ndoctors; but whether he’ll live or not I can’t say. But we’d best get\\r\\nyou along to the doctor and have your cut properly bandaged.’Jack had also received a prick from a lance on his thigh, which, though\\r\\nbleeding profusely, was not very painful. He, however, insisted on\\r\\nremaining at his duty, and with Barrymore’s help went on to their\\r\\ncamping-ground.Will was loud in his praises of Jack’s gallantry. ‘You ought to get your\\r\\ncommission,’ he said. ‘If some blessed officer had done what you’ve done\\r\\nhe’d have got a step in the regiment, half-a-dozen letters after his\\r\\nname, and I don’t know what all.’‘Never mind, Will, old boy; get me a drink of coffee from somewhere, and\\r\\nany one can have the letters and the promotion.{165}’Pearson and Brandon had just succeeded in roasting some green\\r\\ncoffee-beans, and soon Jack had a pannikin of the hot beverage, to which\\r\\na little drop of rum had been added. The drink did Jack much good and he\\r\\nsoon felt better. In the evening he went up to the hospital-tent with\\r\\nWill and inquired about Tom Gallon.The gray-headed, kind-eyed Scot who was regimental surgeon shook his\\r\\nhead. ‘He may live,’ he said; ‘but his soldiering days are over. His\\r\\nleft arm ‘s smashed and must come off above the elbow, and he’s got a\\r\\nnasty dig in his back. Providing we can keep off fever, he may pull\\r\\nround; but I’m afraid’——-The doctor shook Jack warmly by the hand. ‘You performed a brave deed,’\\r\\nhe said. ‘I heard of the affair from Captain Norreys, who’s bringing it\\r\\nto the notice of Lord Raglan. But what’s wrong with your head?’Jack replied that he had received a slight cut, which the doctor\\r\\ninsisted upon dressing, besides the prod in his leg, making Jack relate\\r\\nhow he had saved Gallon the while.That night the army was encamped in order of battle, for it was expected\\r\\nthe Russians would make a night-attack. They were known to be quite\\r\\nclose and in great strength, part of which they had revealed in their\\r\\nattempts to draw the British cavalry into an{166} ambush. The troops piled\\r\\narms and were warned to be ready to turn out at an instant’s notice.\\r\\nExtra strong vedettes and outposts were posted; but Jack’s regiment was\\r\\nfortunate in not being called upon to supply either.They were encamped just behind the village of Bulganak, Lord Raglan\\r\\npassing the night in a posthouse close to the bridge. From the English\\r\\nlines the camp-fires of the enemy, seeming endless in number, could be\\r\\nplainly seen, and all knew that even if they went through the night\\r\\nwithout an attack the next day would see them engaged in a big battle,\\r\\nfor the Russians barred all further progress towards Sebastopol.The night passed peacefully, however, and before dawn, without sound of\\r\\ntrumpet or drum, the French and English got under arms. Little time was\\r\\ntaken over breakfast, the last meal many hundreds of the gallant fellows\\r\\nwere fated to eat; then the troops began to take up their position for\\r\\nthe advance. But it was some time before the army got on the move. When\\r\\nthey did, Jack, who with his regiment still marched on the left flank,\\r\\nsaw large bodies of Cossacks and other cavalry on the hills and ridges,\\r\\nand the sight of burning villages and homesteads showed the Allies that\\r\\nthe Russians were pursuing their old tactics of destroying everything as\\r\\nthey retired before their enemy.The advance was across gently undulating country towards a range of\\r\\nsteep heights, ending near the sea in great cliffs, some hundreds of\\r\\nfeet high. With one or two protracted halts in between, the Allies\\r\\ntowards midday had approached to within about a mile and a half of these\\r\\nheights, and there another long halt was{167} made while the English right\\r\\ngot into touch with the French left.Jack could see at the base of the cliffs the river, with the knolls,\\r\\nridges, and gullies beyond it. The opening in the hills through which\\r\\nthe road to Sebastopol ran was also visible. A commanding height, which\\r\\nJack afterwards learnt was the Kourgane Hill, stood out plainly. Several\\r\\nsmall villages were visible on the Russian side of the river, between\\r\\nthe sea and the Kourgane Hill, and cottages and farmhouses were\\r\\nscattered about.The practised eye of the soldier could discern across the river large\\r\\nbodies of cavalry on the move, while enormous masses of gray-coated\\r\\ninfantry were amongst the slopes and ravines, the whole position simply\\r\\nbristling with field-batteries and howitzers. In front of the Kourgane\\r\\nHill a great redoubt, armed with fourteen guns of heavy calibre, had\\r\\nbeen erected, and this was the ‘key’ of the Russian position. Around\\r\\nthis it was fated that the fiercest fighting of the day was to take\\r\\nplace.Sergeant Linham had approached Jack, and he looked grimly at the strong\\r\\nposition. ‘Ha, hum!’ he said, ‘many a man will lose the number of his\\r\\nmess before those heights are carried; but we shall do it.’Just then the dense blue-uniformed masses of French infantry were seen\\r\\nmoving forward to attack the Russian right. They advanced with a deal of\\r\\ndash, artillery supporting them. Soon a tremendous cannonade was in full\\r\\nprogress, and the English line was halted till the French had achieved\\r\\ntheir object.Presently the English again moved forward, and the objects on the other\\r\\nside of the river became{168} plain. It was then about one o’clock, the day\\r\\nwas hot and cloudless; the sun shone down on what, had they not been\\r\\nadvancing in the grim reality of war, would have been a glorious\\r\\nspectacle. Arms glittered, plumes waved, colours fluttered.\\r\\nScarlet-coated light infantry, fated to bear the brunt of that day’s\\r\\nfighting, sombre-clad Riflemen, kilted Highlanders, bearskinned Guards,\\r\\ngaily braided artillerymen—all moved forward in the most beautiful\\r\\norder. No haste, no uncertainty; everything staid, orderly, majestic.\\r\\nArrived within about a mile of the river, the British regiments began to\\r\\ndeploy, and with the utmost coolness and precision moved forward for\\r\\nattack.Presently a boom was heard from the position in front of Jack’s\\r\\ndivision, and a round-shot came ripping across the river. Another and\\r\\nanother followed, and soon a tremendous cannonade was opened on the\\r\\nEnglish. Jack felt a sort of tightening of his heartstrings as the\\r\\nthunder of the artillery began; but the feeling of nervous anxiety died\\r\\naway when he saw with what absolute indifference to danger our gallant\\r\\ninfantrymen deployed under a heavy fire.The Lancers were dismounted and a field-artillery battery was passing\\r\\nthem on its way to the front when the reins suddenly dropped from a\\r\\ndriver’s hands; he gave a sort of gasp, and then fell heavily on the\\r\\nground.‘Sunstroke,’ said Sergeant Barrymore, who was close by Jack, and running\\r\\nto the artilleryman he turned him on his back and dragged him away from\\r\\nthe wheels of the guns. As he did so, the front of the man’s tunic was\\r\\nseen to be wet with blood. A splinter of shell had struck him in the\\r\\nheart! He{169} was the first Englishman killed that day, and Sergeant\\r\\nBarrymore, new to war, went silently back to his horse.Presently the Lancers were ordered to mount, and a further advance was\\r\\nmade till they were pretty close to the river. Musket and rifle balls\\r\\nbegan to hum over their heads, and they were again dismounted. From the\\r\\nspot where Jack was he could obtain a very good view of the field, and,\\r\\nhis heart throbbing wildly, he gazed upon the fascinating scene. The\\r\\nround-shot were now causing considerable execution, and the regiments of\\r\\nthe Light Division were ordered to lie down. Here a terrible trial of\\r\\npassive endurance awaited them. Round-shot tore through them, shells\\r\\nexploded over them, while a shower of bullets pinged and buzzed about\\r\\nthem. Casualties were frequent, but the gallant fellows, few of whom had\\r\\never been under fire before, bore their trial bravely. They laughed and\\r\\njoked, and as they watched the dread guns which were spreading death and\\r\\ndestruction amongst them they began to distinguish their different\\r\\nsounds. Then men were heard remarking, ‘Look out, Bill, here’s Shrieking\\r\\nEliza coming again!’ or ‘There goes Barking Tom!’Every now and then a mighty blast of wind would sweep by a soldier, the\\r\\nearth would receive a shattering shock, and what one instant was a\\r\\nliving soldier would next be a shapeless mass. His comrades would rise\\r\\nand gently carry his remains to the rear; then resume their places. This\\r\\nwent on for a terrible time, till even the iron nerves of the British\\r\\nsoldiers began to feel the strain.‘We ain’t afraid of dying,’ said a man of the 33rd to his captain; ‘but\\r\\nwe’d like to have a{170} smack at they Rooshians. Lead us on, sir; lead us\\r\\non.’‘Steady, men—steady,’ was the reply; ‘we shall get our chance\\r\\ndirectly.’ And the intrepid officers would walk up and down in front of\\r\\ntheir companies to inspire confidence in the men.The British were waiting till the French had effected the turning\\r\\nmovement; but they were in difficulties, and time passed slowly. The\\r\\nLight Division began to murmur; a lull took place in the battle. Affairs\\r\\nseemed critical.Lord Raglan and his staff rode up and down the line, the round-shot\\r\\nploughing up the ground all round them. The commander-in-chief looked\\r\\nanxious. At last he made up his mind to advance.At that time the village of Bourliouk was set in flames, which caused\\r\\nmuch confusion, as it was impossible for the English to cross the river\\r\\nfor a space of two hundred yards on either side of the burning mass. The\\r\\nsmoke also blotted out that part of the field from the view.Nothing, however, could daunt the British. A staff-officer, the\\r\\nimpetuous Nolan, in his resplendent Hussar uniform, was seen to gallop\\r\\nalong the lines of the Light Division, saying a few words to each\\r\\ncommander. Then the regiments sprang to their feet—the 7th, 23rd, and\\r\\n77th—dressed their ranks, and with a front of two miles and a depth of\\r\\nonly two men marched grandly down the slope.The cavalry gave them a tremendous cheer. But the light infantry made no\\r\\nsound; the joyous light of battle was in their eyes, their blood was\\r\\naroused. They were going to close with the enemy, they would soon be at\\r\\ngrips with him, it was enough. As they{171} neared the river the guns of the\\r\\ngreater part of three field-batteries, a battery manned by sailors, the\\r\\nlight guns of the lesser redoubt, and the fourteen guns of the great\\r\\nredoubt, opened with shot and shell upon them. Sixteen battalions of\\r\\ninfantry in front and four on each flank poured in a terrific\\r\\nmusketry-fire, and a perfect inferno of iron whizzed around them.‘God help them!’ cried Jack, his heart wrung at the sight; ‘mortal men\\r\\ncan never face such a fury of destruction.’The advancing regiments reached the river, into which they boldly\\r\\nplunged. Some were only up to their knees; some sank at once to their\\r\\narmpits; some had to abandon their arms and swim for their lives; while\\r\\nothers, alas! sank, and were seen no more. The surface of the water was\\r\\nliterally lashed into foam by the iron and leaden hail that swept into\\r\\nit; but with a rush the British were across and sheltered for a moment\\r\\nby the steep banks from the murderous fire of the Russians. Then, headed\\r\\nby their officers, they scrambled up the incline. All formation was\\r\\nlost, and the men of the different regiments got mixed together as they\\r\\ncharged up the slope towards the batteries. As they crowned the ridge, a\\r\\nmob of desperate, fearless men, showers of grape and canister mowed its\\r\\nway through them,{172} literally cutting lanes in the crowded masses, while\\r\\nthe infantry on their flanks poured in volleys at point-blank range.\\r\\nStill they advanced, every foot of the way being marked with slain or\\r\\nwounded men.The gallant Fusiliers, 7th and 23rd, smitten sorely, reeled like drunken\\r\\nmen; but still they went on, led by the gallant Lacy Yea. The General\\r\\nhad but one idea—to lead his division right up to the fiery jaws of the\\r\\nguns belching death and destruction around. He was well in front, a\\r\\nconspicuous figure in his cocked hat and mounted on his gray Arab,\\r\\nwaving his sword and encouraging his men.Ah! he’s down; his horse is killed! In a moment he is again on his feet,\\r\\nwaving his sword and crying, ‘I’m all right, 23rd! Be sure I’ll remember\\r\\nthis day!’The red-coats opened a rapid fire upon the masses of gray-coated\\r\\nRussians, who began to waver; those behind the breastwork were soon seen\\r\\nin retreat. They did not like the light in the eyes of the British lads.\\r\\nThen the bayonets were levelled, a great cheer went up, and the gallant\\r\\n‘Light Bobs’ went at the great redoubt. The Russians were stricken with\\r\\nterror; before the foremost red-coats got amongst them they had limbered\\r\\nup their guns and were seen dragging them away. The British gave a yell\\r\\nand raced forward, swarmed up the escarpment, leaped through the\\r\\nembrasures, and in a moment were in amongst the enemy, bayoneting the\\r\\nartillerymen.One Russian driver was urging with whip and spur his black horses to\\r\\ncarry off the last gun. An officer of the 23rd rushed forward, seized\\r\\nthe bridle, and stopped the horses. The driver slipped from the saddle\\r\\nand bolted. Gun and horses were captured;{173} the latter to serve in our\\r\\nblack battery, the former to be sent to England as a trophy.[3]The remains of the Light Division were in possession of the famous great\\r\\nredoubt; but the Guards and Highlanders had not advanced to support\\r\\nthem, and they were isolated. The dense masses of Russians, seeing this,\\r\\nhalted, then turned back.The Light Division was in a critical position. This could be seen much\\r\\nmore plainly from the British side of the river than from the Russian,\\r\\non account of the numerous dips, ravines, and gullies among which our\\r\\ninfantry lay.Lord Lucan, in command of the cavalry, observed with great anxiety the\\r\\ncritical position of the remnant of the Light Division. To add to his\\r\\nconsternation, he saw an immense mass of cavalry, fully three thousand\\r\\nstrong, wheeling slowly round from the south-eastern slopes of the\\r\\nKourgane Hill, as though in readiness, when the Russian infantry had\\r\\ndriven the red-coats from the redoubt, to charge down upon them and\\r\\nannihilate them. Under these circumstances the cavalry commander\\r\\ndetermined to take a decisive step. Without orders from Lord Raglan, he\\r\\ndecided to cross the river, advance to the support of the Light\\r\\nDivision, hold the hordes of Russian cavalry in check, and if necessary\\r\\nto charge them.He mounted his brigade and rode up to Major Willett, commanding Jack’s\\r\\nregiment. ‘I am going to advance across the river,’ he said; ‘your\\r\\nregiment will lead. Send word to Lord Raglan of what I am doing. I shall\\r\\nmyself lead the advance.’Major Willett saluted with his sword. ‘Cornet Leland,’ he said, ‘gallop\\r\\nto Lord Raglan and tell him{174} the cavalry brigade is crossing the river\\r\\nto the assistance of the light infantry division which is threatened on\\r\\nthe flank with an overwhelming mass of cavalry.’Captain Norreys, possessing the advantage of having seen war-service,\\r\\nspoke to Major Willett. ‘I should send three or four men,’ he said. ‘It\\r\\nis doubtful if any one man would get through such a fire-zone; but, out\\r\\nof several, one is almost sure to.’‘Well thought of, Norreys,’ said the major.—‘Mr Leland, take three men,\\r\\nand whoever gets through will deliver the message.’Jack’s heart leapt at these words, and with a touch of the spur he made\\r\\nDainty bound from her place in the ranks. He settled himself in the\\r\\nsaddle.‘Thank goodness we’re going to do something at last!’ he said to\\r\\nPearson. ‘If we once get in the thick of it we’ll have a go at some of\\r\\nthose Russian beggars before we retire;’ and next moment he was swinging\\r\\nalong, under a heavy fire, behind Cornet Leland and Sergeant Barrymore,\\r\\non their way to find Lord Raglan.{175}Presently they rode into a very fury of shot and shell, and their danger\\r\\nwas as great from the British as from the Russians. They got by in\\r\\nsafety, however, when they had to make a detour to pass the\\r\\nstill-blazing village of Bourliouk.The Second Division, in the midst of a terrific fire, was then gallantly\\r\\nattempting to ascend the heights. Cornet Leland learnt that Lord Raglan\\r\\nhad crossed the river, and with a word to his men turned and dashed into\\r\\nthe stream. Sergeant Barrymore put his horse at the water, but the\\r\\nanimal shied and almost threw his rider. Pearson dashed by and followed\\r\\nhis officer; then Barrymore and Jack splashed into the water. A regular\\r\\nhail of bullets flew round them, and when they were about half-way\\r\\nacross Sergeant Barrymore’s horse was struck and immediately rolled\\r\\nover, carrying his rider with him. The sergeant’s foot was entangled in\\r\\nhis stirrup and he was in danger of drowning; but Jack managed to seize\\r\\nhis pouch-belt, and, turning his horse round, dragged him to the bank\\r\\nagain.{176}At that moment a staff-officer came dashing across the river, and was\\r\\npassing Jack and Sergeant Barrymore when he suddenly uttered a loud cry\\r\\nand dropped from the saddle. Jack ran up to him as he lay on the ground\\r\\nand found him pale and bleeding. He was either a colonel or brigadier,\\r\\nand seemed a man of some importance.‘Yes, yes,’ said the poor officer—‘quick! I’m af-afraid—shall faint.\\r\\nTake paper—Sir Colin—Colin—Campbell, Guards and High—High’——The poor fellow had just strength enough to nod his head, and then Jack\\r\\nseized the paper, and leaping into his saddle galloped back through the\\r\\nstorm of missiles to where the Guards and Highlanders were forming for\\r\\nthe advance.Jack knew the stern, rugged features of Sir Colin Campbell, and riding\\r\\nup to him gave both the message and the letter.‘Ay, ay, I know as well as any one can tell me the necessity to\\r\\nadvance,’ said the gallant Scotsman. ‘If the Light Division had kept\\r\\ntheir formation and not run away with themselves we should have been\\r\\nclose behind them now. But how is it you bring me this message? Are the\\r\\nstaff all down?’Jack explained the circumstances, and Sir Colin said, ‘Remain where you\\r\\nare till you have seen us cross the river, then return and report to\\r\\nLord Raglan.’Sir Colin had carefully selected the spot where{177} his regiments were to\\r\\ncross, and he led them himself.First came the 42nd, the gallant Black Watch, whose last war-service had\\r\\nbeen at Waterloo, when, clinging to the stirrups of their countrymen,\\r\\nthe Scots Greys, they had charged upon the French, shouting, ‘Scotland\\r\\nfor ever!’ Then the 93rd Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, who had\\r\\ncovered themselves with glory in the Peninsula; and, lastly, the 79th,\\r\\nthe stern fighting Cameronians, whose band had played the Lancers into\\r\\nPortsmouth.The Guards, those giants from the Metropolis, led by the Duke of\\r\\nCambridge, marching with a contemptuous indifference to the bullets\\r\\nflying round them, were already in the river when the Highlanders, with\\r\\ntheir flowing tartans and nodding Highland bonnets, their faces aglow\\r\\nwith the fierce joy of the warrior about to grapple with his foe, dashed\\r\\ninto the river.Moving more quickly and in perfect order, the Highlanders, with much\\r\\nless loss than the other regiments, gained the vineyard on the opposite\\r\\nbank, where, as they marched, they snatched handfuls of grapes to quench\\r\\ntheir burning thirst.Having seen the division cross, Jack galloped off to find Lord Raglan\\r\\nand report. He put Dainty at the river at the spot where the\\r\\nstaff-officer had crossed, and, penetrating into the Russian lines, he\\r\\nrode on, getting higher and higher, till presently, in front of him, he\\r\\nsaw on a knoll commanding a view of the Russian army Lord Raglan and the\\r\\nheadquarter staff. Just behind them were Cornet Leland and Pearson.Jack galloped up and delivered his message. The{178} one-armed veteran\\r\\nlooked at the trumpeter. ‘I see them now advancing,’ he said, ‘and\\r\\ngallantly are they doing it.’ He again put his glasses to his eyes and\\r\\nlooked over the field on which the battle raged.Jack rejoined Cornet Leland and looked round him. He could see the\\r\\nmassive column of Russians opposing the English advance, and behind them\\r\\ndense bodies of gray-coated reserves.A French aide-de-camp came galloping up to Lord Raglan. ‘My lord, my\\r\\nlord!’ he cried in great agitation; ‘we are terribly outnumbered, we are\\r\\nsurrounded, we are lost!’Lord Raglan smiled in his courteous way. ‘I will spare you a battalion,’\\r\\nhe said; and gave the necessary order. He then gazed long at the Russian\\r\\nflank, suddenly exclaiming, ‘Now, if we had a couple of guns here!’Cornet Leland heard the words, and, immediately saluting, he cried,\\r\\n‘Will you allow me to carry the message for you, my lord?’‘Certainly, and then rejoin your regiment with your men; the fewer\\r\\nmounted men here the less likely we shall be to attract attention.’On through the hail of bullets again, across the river, and away to\\r\\nwhere Turner’s battery of Horse Artillery were doing grand work. Cornet\\r\\nLeland explained what was wanted, and at once the battery started. At a\\r\\ngallop, which threatened to overturn the nine-pounders, they made for\\r\\nthe ford across the river. On their way one of the wheelers was killed\\r\\nand the leading gun came to a halt. Instantly the traces were cut, and,\\r\\nleaving the dead horse, on they{179} went again. It was a tremendous\\r\\nstruggle to get the guns up the steep bank, Jack and the others\\r\\ndismounting and pulling round the spokes till the perspiration poured\\r\\noff the men. Then on again over the steep, rugged ground till they\\r\\nreached the knoll. Only two guns had arrived, and the gunners had been\\r\\nleft behind. The officers dismounted, unlimbered, and laid the guns\\r\\nthemselves.They were pointed at the flank of the causeway batteries. The first shot\\r\\nfailed, so did the second, but the third exploded right over the Russian\\r\\nbattery and struck a tumbrel, which exploded with a tremendous roar. A\\r\\nfew more shots followed, and then the Russians were seen limbering up\\r\\nand retiring.Cornet Leland and his men then departed to find their regiment. As they\\r\\ngot near the great redoubt they saw the remnants of the gallant 7th\\r\\nFusiliers still maintaining a great struggle with overwhelming masses of\\r\\ngray-coated infantrymen in glittering spiked helmets.The great mass came slowly, very slowly, forward with levelled bayonets\\r\\nas though to charge; but the Fusiliers, in groups and clusters, with no\\r\\nsort of formation, kept firing into them, losing heavily themselves, but\\r\\ndoing much more execution. The sight was so fascinating that the Lancers\\r\\nstayed to watch it—stayed till the heroic resolution of the Fusiliers\\r\\ninfused such terror into the hearts of the stricken Russians that with a\\r\\nkind of wailing cry they broke and retired, but only to form again.Farther on the Scots Fusilier Guards had advanced and been repulsed; the\\r\\nGrenadiers and Coldstreams,{180} with a proud mien, were advancing, though\\r\\nthey were being mowed down in long swathes. They literally staggered\\r\\nbefore the storm of shot, and an officer approaching Sir Colin Campbell\\r\\nsaid, ‘The brigade of Guards will be destroyed; ought it not to fall\\r\\nback?’To which the stern old General replied, ‘It’s better, sir, that every\\r\\nman of her Majesty’s Guards should lie dead upon the field than that\\r\\nthey should now turn their backs upon the enemy!’There was no need for fear, however. The blood of the English was up;\\r\\nall they kept clamouring for was to be led forward.The Grenadiers and Coldstreams engaged six battalions of the celebrated\\r\\nVladimir and Kazan regiments, and after firing for some time advanced\\r\\nand with the bayonet-point put them to flight. The time for the\\r\\nHighlanders had arrived. Sir Colin said a few words. ‘Be steady!’ he\\r\\ncried; ‘fire low! Now, men, the army will watch us; make me proud of my\\r\\nHighland Brigade.’Sir Colin rode in front of the 42nd. Before him was the redoubt from\\r\\nwhich the Light Division, spite of heroic resistance, had been driven.\\r\\nHeavy columns, till now hardly engaged, faced him. With three battalions\\r\\nSir Colin was about to engage twelve.Swiftly, almost silently, the Highlanders seemed to glide up the hill.\\r\\nSir Colin’s charger was killed; he mounted another horse, and continued\\r\\nto lead his men. The advance was quickened, the men firing as they went;\\r\\nthe columns swept on, the formation being echelon of regiments, the 42nd\\r\\nleading, the 93rd next, the 79th last.Tremendous and ear-splitting volleys burst from the Highlanders and the\\r\\nGuards, very different from{181} the sputtering fire maintained by the Light\\r\\nDivision earlier in the day. The Russians seemed enveloped in fire, and\\r\\never the men in the bearskins and those in the tossing Highland bonnets\\r\\nadvanced.Presently they met, and Guards and Highlanders got to work with the\\r\\nbayonet. The Russians stood a minute; then, with another sorrowful wail\\r\\nlike the cry of a strong man defeated, they broke and retired. A\\r\\ntremendous cheer burst from the hitherto silent Guards and Highlanders,\\r\\nthe advantage was pressed hard, the retreat was turned into a rout, and\\r\\nthe Russians ran, while a fury of lead poured into them and smote them\\r\\ndown.Meanwhile the two guns on the knoll with Lord Raglan had been augmented\\r\\nby a battery, and these opened a tremendous fire on the retreating\\r\\nRussians. Other batteries crossed the river, and frightful execution was\\r\\ndone.The heights of the Alma were won, the greatest battle since Waterloo had\\r\\nbeen fought, and the Allies were triumphant.‘Hurrah, the day is ours!’ cried Cornet Leland; ‘let us rejoin our\\r\\nregiment.’ And putting spurs to their horses in ten minutes they were\\r\\nwith the Light Cavalry Brigade.One of the first to welcome Jack was Sergeant Barrymore, who, wet\\r\\nthrough as he was, had managed to rejoin his regiment. He was mounted on\\r\\nthe horse of a trooper who had been wounded. A few words of\\r\\ncongratulation passed, then the advance was sounded.By squadrons the different regiments advanced, and increasing the pace\\r\\nto a trot they reached the crest of the hill in front of them. They were\\r\\nescorting a{182} battery of artillery, which on mounting the crest opened\\r\\nfire on the retreating Russians. Numbers of stragglers, many of them\\r\\nofficers of rank, were seen in the dip before them, and the ground being\\r\\npracticable for cavalry, Lord Lucan formed his squadrons into column and\\r\\nordered them to pursue and capture as many as they could. The delighted\\r\\ntroopers shot forward, and soon a good many prisoners were made.Jack’s troop and a troop of the 11th Hussars came upon a large body of\\r\\nthe defeated Vladimir regiment, covering the retreat of a number of\\r\\nofficers, and, extraordinary sight, several carriages. With a shout the\\r\\ntroopers charged forward, when the Russians delivered a volley which\\r\\nemptied one or two saddles; then the troopers were in amongst them; but\\r\\nthere was no more fight left in the Russians, who immediately threw down\\r\\ntheir arms and surrendered.Some score of Lancers and Hussars went off after the carriages, and\\r\\nseveral officers of rank were captured. Jack was passing on when he\\r\\nheard a piercing shriek, and, turning, beheld an extraordinary sight. A\\r\\ncarriage drawn by four horses had been galloping off when some Hussars\\r\\nspurred after it, threatened the driver with their swords unless he\\r\\nstopped, and then dismounting had opened the carriage door.A young, handsome girl, beautifully dressed, jumped from the carriage,\\r\\nwhen a Hussar, poking in his head, called to his comrade, and together\\r\\nthey dragged out an officer in a gorgeous white uniform, over which he\\r\\nwore a silver cuirass. The officer, on being taken, had drawn a pistol\\r\\nand fired at the Hussar, who promptly raised his sword to run the\\r\\nRussian through.{183} It was this which had caused the young lady to shriek.Seeing what was happening, Jack made Dainty leap to the spot, and\\r\\nholding up his hand he cried out to the Hussar, ‘Don’t strike, man;\\r\\ndon’t you see the Russian is wounded?’The girl had seen Jack’s upraised hand, and without understanding what\\r\\nhe said, guessed he was pleading for the Russian’s life.‘Oh monsieur, monsieur!’ she cried in French, which language Jack spoke\\r\\nfluently—‘oh monsieur, save my brother!’ and she ran forward and clung\\r\\nto Jack’s stirrup.Jack rode up to the officer, whom he now saw was very young, and cried,\\r\\n‘Monsieur, deliver up your sword; you are my prisoner.’‘I am wounded, as you see,’ said the officer with a slight curl of the\\r\\nlip, ‘or I would die rather than surrender.’‘It is the fortune of war,’ said Jack, receiving the sword, which he\\r\\nhanded to the Hussar, saying, ‘He is your prisoner, comrade.’‘Keep him,’ said the Hussar; ‘I don’t want him.—Come on, Dick!’ he\\r\\ncried to his comrade. ‘Mount again; there’s plenty to be done yet!’ and\\r\\naway they went.Jack looked embarrassed. ‘Your brother is my prisoner,’ he said, ‘and I\\r\\nmust take him to my officer; but you, mademoiselle, what are you doing\\r\\nhere? You had better get into your carriage and depart. We do not make\\r\\nwar on women.’‘Oh monsieur, I came out with others from Sebastopol to see the battle.\\r\\nWe were told the English and French would be driven into the sea. My\\r\\nbrother was on the staff of Prince Mentschikoff, and he was shot through\\r\\nthe leg. He is Count Pauloff, lieutenant in the Emperor’s Chevalier\\r\\nGuards. If he is prisoner I remain with him.’‘That is so,’ said the officer, who was lying on the ground, raising\\r\\nhimself on his elbow. ‘Irma will remain with me to nurse me.’At that moment the trumpets were heard sounding the recall over and over\\r\\nagain, and Jack, surprised, was about to obey.‘I will help you back into your carriage,’ he said to Count Pauloff;\\r\\n‘tell the driver to follow our troop.’ With the aid of the coachman the\\r\\ncount was laid inside, when Sergeant Barrymore came riding up to Jack.‘Mount and follow me, Blair,’ he said; ‘orders have been received that\\r\\nwe retire at once. No prisoners are to be taken; all are to be\\r\\nreleased.’In a few words Jack explained to the astonished count that he was free,\\r\\nthough the young officer could hardly believe it. He and his sister\\r\\nbegan to thank Jack most profusely, and would not allow him{185} a minute in\\r\\nwhich to explain they had nothing to thank him for.He was about to mount when the count tore a small gold cross from round\\r\\nhis neck. ‘Keep this in remembrance of one who will be ever grateful to\\r\\nyou,’ he said. ‘If ever it is in my power to repay you rely upon me,’\\r\\nand he handed the cross to Jack.As Jack took it the count seized his hand. ‘You are not an officer, I\\r\\nsee,’ he said; ‘but you have the manners of a gentleman. Adieu, brave\\r\\nsoldier! you should wear golden epaulets!’Jack shut the door of the carriage, into which the lady had jumped, and\\r\\nthe Russian driver, at a word from her, whipped up his horses and\\r\\nfollowed his countrymen, while Jack and Sergeant Barrymore trotted off\\r\\nto join their comrades.The Russians fired one solitary gun, their cavalry made some show of\\r\\ncovering their retreat, and the battle was ended.Round one, Jack, Will, Sergeant Linham, Pearson, and Brandon were\\r\\nsitting. They were all moody and silent. A great battle had been fought,\\r\\na great victory had been won; but there was no jubilation in their\\r\\nhearts.Darkness fortunately hid from them the terrible sights by which they\\r\\nwere surrounded, but it could not shut out the sounds. Groans and cries\\r\\nand moanings for water were heard from all sides, and the lanterns\\r\\nbobbing about in different parts of the field showed where the doctors\\r\\nand ambulance-men were busy. For hours Jack and Will had wandered over\\r\\nthe field, taking water to the wounded and often helping to place some\\r\\nshattered hero in a more comfortable position till the doctors—or\\r\\ndeath—should come to him.Later, they had eaten their ration of pork by the camp-fire, and now\\r\\nthey sat gloomily looking into the flickering flames.Pearson sucked moodily at his pipe. ‘Hearts will be sore in England when\\r\\nthe news of this day’s work is known,’ he said presently.‘Ay, and hearts will be glad,’ growled Sergeant Linham; ‘the cry of the\\r\\norphans will be drowned in{187} the shouts over the victory. And so it ought\\r\\nto be. We’re soldiers, aren’t we, and it’s our trade to kill or be\\r\\nkilled? Our relations know this, and must expect some of us to go.’‘And I want to know,’ said the sergeant, taking his pipe from his\\r\\nmouth—‘I want to know what difference does it make whether we go now,\\r\\non the field of battle, or in a few years’ time in some hospital? Now, I\\r\\nwant to know that.’No one answered Linham, and, his beak-like nose looking more aggressive\\r\\nby the flickering light of the fire, he continued, ‘It’s better to die a\\r\\nsoldier’s sudden death than to lie in bed for weeks like a mangy cur. A\\r\\nsoldier’s death is a glorious one, though many a life was thrown away\\r\\nto-day.’‘Bad leading,’ said Linham solemnly; ‘we’ve been too long at peace. Our\\r\\nGenerals are the bravest men on earth; but the way the poor Light Bobs\\r\\nwere mishandled, charging up the hillside in a mob, and then left\\r\\nunsupported! Bah, we didn’t fight like that in India!’Again there was a silence, so Sergeant Linham, knocking the ashes from\\r\\nhis pipe, wrapped his cloak round him. ‘It would have been different if\\r\\nour old General that the colonel and I served under in India had been\\r\\nhere. Now, I want to know what you think he’d ha’ done. I\\r\\nwant—to—know’—— A faint snore finished the sentence. The sergeant\\r\\nhad fallen asleep, an example which the others tried to follow; but they\\r\\nfound it a difficult task.Fresh to the horrors of warfare, they could not get the recollection of\\r\\nthe terrible sights they had seen{188} out of their minds, and when at last\\r\\nthey did drop into fitful slumbers it was only to go through again in\\r\\ntheir dreams the terrors of the day. It was a positive relief to Jack\\r\\nwhen, long before dawn, reveille aroused him.Orders were received that some squadrons of cavalry should at once try\\r\\nand get in touch again with the enemy and find out where he was and what\\r\\nhe was doing. Without bite or sup the Lancers mounted and moved off in\\r\\nthe darkness. The road was easy to follow. Arms, accoutrements, and dead\\r\\nor wounded men strewed the way. They had not got very far when daylight\\r\\novertook them, and advancing with great caution they accelerated their\\r\\npace.Helmets, shakos, greatcoats, arms of every description littered the\\r\\nground, and the practised eye of Captain Norreys told him that it had\\r\\nbeen a panic-stricken crowd which had passed along there a few hours\\r\\nbefore.As the sun came out the men got cheerier and threw off something of the\\r\\ndepression which seemed to have fallen upon them. They left the road and\\r\\ncrossed the undulating grass-covered plains that led up to the heights.\\r\\nSeveral times during the early morning small parties of Cossacks had\\r\\nbeen seen; but these, on observing the British troops, turned and\\r\\ngalloped off as if for their lives.Presently the reconnoitring cavalry came in sight of the defeated\\r\\nRussian army, which had evidently encamped for the night on a river\\r\\nwhich the English afterwards found was named the Katcha. It was clear\\r\\nthat the alarm had been given, for on the north side of the river\\r\\ncavalry and artillery could be seen{189} trotting rapidly away, while\\r\\nstrings of infantry and baggage all mixed up together streamed along\\r\\nafter them. The troops still on the British side of the river were\\r\\nstraining every effort to get across, for it was plain they imagined the\\r\\nhandful of Lancers they saw was but the advanced guard of the British\\r\\narmy.On the little bridge a terrible jam had taken place. Men, horses, wagons\\r\\nwere all mixed up in an inextricable mass, and it was clear to Jack that\\r\\nthe army beneath him was only a panic-stricken mob. Men could be seen\\r\\nusing whips, officers the flats of their swords, while a confused murmur\\r\\nof voices ascended to the hills. Hundreds of Russians, throwing away the\\r\\nheaviest part of their kit, could be seen dashing into the river and\\r\\nwading across, joining their countrymen on the other side in their mad\\r\\nrush for Sebastopol. The Alma had been a terrible lesson!Captain Norreys with one or two other officers dismounted and surveyed\\r\\nthe scene through their glasses.His captain looked long and earnestly at the scene below him, then said\\r\\nin regretful tones, ‘What a mistake we’re making, lying inactive on the\\r\\nAlma with a beaten foe but a few miles from us! With a dozen squadrons\\r\\nand a horse-battery I’d engage that not one of those Russians ever\\r\\nentered Sebastopol.’The reconnoitring party ate the rations they had with them, and, having\\r\\nseen the last of the Russians cross the bridge, returned to their camp.\\r\\nThey found every one available busy tending the wounded and burying the\\r\\ndead—English, French, and Russian—and a melancholy task it was. In the\\r\\nbattle fell 5709 Russians, 2002 British, and 560 French. As Jack{190} rode\\r\\nover the battlefield he closed his eyes to shut out the terrible sights.The sailors from the vessels were invaluable, and handled the wounded\\r\\nwith all the gentleness of women. Many of the poor fellows had to be\\r\\ncarried fully four miles to the shore; but despite that more than a\\r\\nthousand were got aboard.In regimental orders that day there were several surprises for Jack. He\\r\\nfound he was promoted corporal ‘for distinguished service rendered at\\r\\nthe skirmish on the Bulganak,’ and Sergeant Linham was to be ‘acting\\r\\ntrumpet-major,’ while Trumpet-major Joyce was named as orderly to Lord\\r\\nRaglan.This was very pleasant news to Jack, and that day he took an opportunity\\r\\nof sending home a few lines; telling his mother of the battle and\\r\\nassuring her of his safety, informing her of his promotion but making no\\r\\nmention of the gallant deed by which he had earned it. ‘It’s the first\\r\\nstep on the ladder,’ said Jack to himself that night as he surveyed his\\r\\ncorporal’s stripes. ‘If ever I live to get home I hope to add a third\\r\\nstripe to these two.{191}’There had been delays, caused partly by the unreadiness of the French,\\r\\nand partly by the vacillating policy of Marshal St Arnaud, the French\\r\\ncommander, a conceited man of mediocre ability, who was even then, poor\\r\\nfellow, dying of disease.Jack’s officer, Captain Norreys, had been appointed on Lord Lucan’s\\r\\nstaff, much to the regret of the troop, who regarded him with the\\r\\ngreatest confidence and respect.‘Leave that behind to find another,’ growled the sergeant, who was not\\r\\nin the best of humours; ‘and mayhap the next you won’t leave behind.\\r\\nYou’ll stay on it, or under it.’Without seeing an enemy, the cavalry descended to the valley of the\\r\\nKatcha, where they had seen the panic-stricken troops from the Alma, and\\r\\nthere they halted. The village was extremely pretty; the homely,\\r\\nvine-clad cottages had gardens then full of bloom in front and rear;\\r\\nwell-filled orchards adjoined the gardens, and the troopers ate their\\r\\nfill of grapes, pears, peaches, and apricots. On entering the cottages,{192}\\r\\nsigns of Russian barbarity were met on all sides—furniture smashed,\\r\\npictures slashed and ripped, boxes and cupboards ransacked, and so on.The main body of the British army bivouacked that night on the Katcha;\\r\\nbut the cavalry pushed on five miles farther, to the Belbeck, where they\\r\\npassed the night more or less uncomfortably, having to stand to their\\r\\nhorses for two hours owing to a false alarm.In the morning it was found that several of the Hussars’ horses had\\r\\nbroken away from their lines, and these had doubtless been the cause of\\r\\nthe alarm. Soon after daylight an officer arrived from Lord Raglan, and\\r\\nhe and Lord Lucan remained some time in conversation.Then the cavalry started upon that daring ‘flank march’ which the\\r\\nineptitude of the dying French commander-in-chief had almost forced Lord\\r\\nRaglan to adopt. The advance was led by an experienced officer said to\\r\\nknow the country. A horse-battery and a battalion of Rifles accompanied\\r\\nthe cavalry, who marched with flankers thrown out. On account of having\\r\\nto keep pace with the Rifles the advance was very slow, the road, which\\r\\nwas bad and often exceedingly steep, leading through a dense forest. A\\r\\nnarrow lane was supposed to lead to a spot known as Mackenzie’s Farm,\\r\\nand this lane was to be left for the artillery and cavalry, the infantry\\r\\nforcing their way in any sort of order through the forest.The men were in high spirits and laughed and chatted gaily as they rode\\r\\nalong, chaffing the sturdy Rifles and bidding them ‘put their best leg\\r\\nforemost.’ After a march of some miles a halt was made, and Jack, who\\r\\nwith his troop was near the head of the column, saw a staff-officer and\\r\\nseveral of the 8th{193} Hussars busy talking together. The lane branched\\r\\ninto two parts, one going straight on, the other going to the right.‘Ha, hum!’ snorted Sergeant Linham, ‘come to a stop I suppose. I’ll bet\\r\\nthey don’t know which road to take.’This seemed to be the case, for the staff-officer was seen to gallop\\r\\nalong one branch, being absent some time. When he returned more talk\\r\\nensued, and then the troops were put in motion again, going straight on.\\r\\nThe horse artillery, however, being some distance in the rear, did not\\r\\nadvance along the same lane as the cavalry, but followed the other, and,\\r\\nas it turned out, the correct one.The road the cavalry was pursuing got narrower and more rutty as they\\r\\nadvanced through densely wooded country, and presently a trumpet rang\\r\\nout the halt.‘We can do anything,’ said Sergeant Linham, riding up. ‘I shouldn’t\\r\\nwonder if we were to come plump upon the Russian cavalry just by\\r\\naccident like—ha, hum! Now, I want to know what’s the use of’——‘D Troop, prepare to dismount! Dismount!’ cried Cornet Leland; and the\\r\\nmen gladly availed themselves of the opportunity of stretching their\\r\\nlegs.‘Bedad, we seem to be playing a game of hide-and-seek,’ he said. ‘It’s\\r\\nthinking I am that a bite and a sup would be welcome now.’‘True enough, Larry; but I’ve only half a biscuit left, and my\\r\\nwater-bottle’s empty,’ said Jack.{194}The men were told they could ‘stand easy,’ and several wandered off a\\r\\nlittle way among the trees. Larry and Jack walked towards a spot where\\r\\nwild-flowers were growing in great luxuriance; and, plucking some of\\r\\nthese, they wandered farther on till they had got some distance from\\r\\ntheir regiments.Presently they came in sight of two tall pine-trees with thin trunks,\\r\\nand they looked at these, then at each other, then both burst out\\r\\nlaughing.‘And never since I left the dear ould counthry have I rivalled the\\r\\nmonkeys,’ said the impetuous Irishman. ‘Jack darlint, I’ll race yez up\\r\\nto the top, and the last one up shall stand the other a dhrink of porter\\r\\nthe first toime we ever set foot in a canteen again.’‘Done!’ said Jack, and in a few moments Lancer and Hussar had doffed\\r\\nheaddress, sword, and instruments, and were climbing for dear life.‘You have, Larry,’ panted Jack; ‘I give you best. But what a fine view\\r\\nwe can get from here! Why, there’s the edge of the forest, and the road,\\r\\nand’——‘Howly Moses, look there to yer left!’ cried Larry, almost dropping from\\r\\nhis perch in his excitement.‘Russians and baggage!’ gasped Jack, as he gazed down into the road on\\r\\nwhich Larry’s eyes were fixed.‘Larry, we’ve made a discovery,’ said Jack. ‘We must get back and bring\\r\\nour fellows down; those wagons must be captured.’The trumpeters turned and ran back at top speed, till they suddenly\\r\\nemerged from between the trees and almost ran into two mounted Hussar\\r\\nofficers.‘You young scoundrels, what’s the meaning of this?’ cried Larry’s\\r\\ncolonel, who was something of a martinet.Larry gave a picturesque account of what had happened, when the Hussar\\r\\ncolonel first ripped out a very strong expression, then, as though\\r\\nseized with a sudden idea, said to his fellow-officer, ‘Major, this\\r\\nconfounded losing our way may turn out to our advantage after all. The\\r\\nartillery can’t be far off; if we could find them we’d ride down, attack\\r\\nthe column, and capture the convoy. Ride like fury to Lord Lucan and\\r\\ntell him what’s happened.’‘If you’ve made a mistake, you scoundrel, I’ll try you by\\r\\ncourt-martial,’ said the colonel. ‘You’d better both mount and scour\\r\\nround to see if you can find the artillery. They must have kept to the\\r\\nleft-{196}hand road when we took the right, and they can’t be far off. If\\r\\nyou find them tell the officer in command to follow us as quickly as he\\r\\ncan. Failing that, rejoin your regiments, or any of the other parties\\r\\nwho are searching the forest for the road we ought to have followed.’Jack and Larry at once mounted and spurred off. Jack, who had a very\\r\\ngood idea of localities, struck away to the left. They rode sharply for\\r\\nten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then they heard a rumble of wheels.They went at a trot, the sound, however, having stopped. Presently they\\r\\nsaw by the increasing light in front of them that they were nearing a\\r\\nroad. They heard voices, spurred forward, and in a few seconds were in\\r\\nthe lane.He turned into the narrow lane, when he saw a group of officers, not in\\r\\nthe blue-and-gold of the artillery, but in scarlet and cocked hats.‘Lord Raglan himself,’ said Jack in hardly audible tones, fixing his\\r\\neyes on a white-haired, one-armed man dressed in a blue frock, who with\\r\\nno very pleased expression on his face rode in the centre of a group of\\r\\nofficers.The trumpeters sat rigidly in their saddles, and{197} dropped their right\\r\\nhands behind their thighs in salute.‘Where do you come from and where are your regiments?’ asked the\\r\\ncommander-in-chief sternly, and by these words the youths knew that the\\r\\ngreat man was exceedingly displeased.{198}‘Comin’ on, me lord. There’s a convoy of Rooshians ahead, an’ we’re\\r\\ngoin’ to cut ’em to pieces, an’——‘I know all about the convoy. Ride off to your regiments as hard as you\\r\\ncan and guide them here. I will hear your explanations later.—Captain\\r\\nWilson, gallop back and fetch up my escort of Hussars.’Without waiting for another word, the trumpeters turned their horses’\\r\\nheads and re-entered the forest.‘His lordship’s in a rage,’ said Jack, as he and Larry went back as hard\\r\\nas they could towards the cavalry column.‘We’ll hurry ’em up,’ said Jack, and seizing his bugle he sounded his\\r\\nregimental call several times.Larry sounded as well, and soon an answering call showed their comrades\\r\\nwere near. Presently Lord Cardigan and a group of officers, Lancers and\\r\\nHussars, came in sight.‘This way, colonel,’ said Larry; ‘Lord Raglan’s in a tearin’ rage,’ and,\\r\\nturning his horse, he led the way.{199}They entered the lane, and in single file (for the way was not wide\\r\\nenough to admit of more) they galloped on.They came up with Lord Raglan. ‘You’re late, my lord,’ he said coldly to\\r\\nLord Cardigan. ‘Come on;’ and he and his staff galloped on with the\\r\\ngroup.They soon came to the end of the lane, and then formed themselves on the\\r\\nhighroad, down which they went. There, a little distance along, they saw\\r\\nthe amazed Russians who were escorting the convoy.The little party of officers and the two trumpeters, drawing their\\r\\nswords, galloped forward. A score of Cossack infantrymen formed together\\r\\nand fired a volley; but the bullets flew high, and in another moment the\\r\\ncavalry were among them, cutting them down. The drivers whipped up their\\r\\nhorses and tried to escape, but Lord Raglan’s escort and straggling\\r\\nLancers and Hussars came galloping down the road.The leading guns of Captain Maude’s battery had also emerged from the\\r\\nlane, unlimbered, and opened fire on the head of the column, which had\\r\\nthe effect of stopping the flight. The infantrymen flung down their arms\\r\\nand surrendered, the mounted men fled, and in five minutes the convoy\\r\\nwas in the hands of the English. The battalion of Rifles came up, and a\\r\\nfew volleys accelerated the retreat of the Russians, who seemed only too\\r\\nglad to get off with their lives without troubling about their property.The spoil of the captured wagons was given over to the soldiers, and a\\r\\nwild scene of plunder took place. The carts were unloaded and the\\r\\ncontents tumbled out on to the road. Boxes were broken open, cases\\r\\nsmashed, portmanteaus slashed up, and an immense{200} quantity of clothing\\r\\nbelonging to the officers of the Saxe-Weimar Hussars was found. Amongst\\r\\nthe spoil were shirts, boots, dressing-cases, valuables, an enormous\\r\\nnumber of fine blue cloth silver-laced jackets and some fur-lined coats;\\r\\nalso many cases of preserved meats and fruits, champagne, spirits; a\\r\\nmilitary chest containing some thousands of roubles; and an immense\\r\\nquantity of ammunition.Lancers, Hussars, Dragoons, artillerymen, Rifles, all were busy. Some\\r\\nsecured valuable watches, others articles of attire, some were eating\\r\\nand drinking, and altogether it was a wonderful sight; the men as they\\r\\ncame out of the woods on to the road eagerly rushing up for their share\\r\\nof the spoil.Jack at first stood aloof; but an artilleryman handing him a bottle of\\r\\nchampagne, he knocked off the neck with his sword, and calling to Larry,\\r\\nwho was enjoying himself immensely, said, ‘Here, Larry, I’ll pay you\\r\\nthat drink I lost; we shall never get tipple like this in the canteen.’‘Shure, Jack, you’re the bhoy for me,’ cried Larry, staggering up under\\r\\na load of fine linen shirts.The champagne finished, the sergeant went to work, and did not desist\\r\\ntill he had secured a good bundle of spoil, amongst which was a\\r\\nmagnificent gold watch.Jack gave a man of the Rifles half-a-sovereign for a splendid fur-lined\\r\\ncoat and pair of high boots, and later on he picked up a Hussar\\r\\nofficer’s jacket which had been thrown down in the road. The latter he\\r\\ngave to Larry for a couple of shirts which he sadly{201} needed, and then he\\r\\nsat down to watch the fun. In an hour’s time nothing was left of the\\r\\nbooty except broken boxes and empty hampers.While they were still halting a staff-officer came riding along, and\\r\\nseeing a number of the 8th Hussars, asked a man if he knew which was the\\r\\ntrumpeter who had ridden up to Lord Raglan in the lane. Larry was\\r\\npointed out to him, when he said, ‘There was a trumpeter of the 17th\\r\\nwith you. I want him too.’‘Come on, Jack,’ said Larry dolefully; ‘we’re in for it. I thought this\\r\\nbit of luck was too good to last.’The two trumpeters, feeling horribly nervous and guilty, marched behind\\r\\nthe staff-officer up towards Mackenzie’s Farm, where Lord Raglan was.\\r\\nThey found the old Peninsular veteran smiling graciously as he talked to\\r\\na number of officers, among whom were Larry’s colonel and Lord Cardigan.Jack and Larry saluted, when Lord Raglan said to the latter in his kind\\r\\ntones, ‘Colonel Powell tells me it was you who first discovered the\\r\\nRussian convoy.’‘Tell us the circumstances,’ said Lord Raglan; and Larry, in a rich\\r\\nbrogue and in a fashion which made several officers hide their mouths\\r\\nbehind their hands, gave an account of their proceedings.Lord Raglan did not smile; but when Larry had finished he said, ‘How\\r\\nlong have you been in the service, O’Callaghan?’‘Four years, me lord, and me father was trumpet-major of the 8th before\\r\\nme, and his father sarved in the Peninsula under the Iron Dook.{202}’‘O’Callaghan,’ he said, ‘you have rendered an important service. By\\r\\nchance I had myself discovered the convoy; but through the cavalry\\r\\nhaving gone astray I might not have been able to capture it had they\\r\\nnot, thanks to you, been coming this way towards the guns. Colonel\\r\\nPowell gives you an excellent character, and at my suggestion he has\\r\\npromoted you to the rank of sergeant. You will be appointed his orderly\\r\\ntrumpeter.’ Then, turning to Jack, he said, ‘Of you, Blair, I have heard\\r\\nbefore. You are the same who gallantly rescued a comrade in the affair\\r\\non the Bulganak, are you not?’‘You succeeded, for I have heard from your regimental doctor that he is\\r\\ndoing well. I shall not forget you. Now you may both go.’The delighted trumpeters rejoined their comrades, and their news was\\r\\nreceived with great satisfaction, for both were deservedly popular in\\r\\ntheir regiments.‘A sargint,’ cried Larry to Jack, ‘an’ orderly to the colonel! Faix, the\\r\\nould dad’ll burst hisself wid joy.’The march was soon continued, the men being in most excellent spirits.\\r\\nLater on in the day they passed Sebastopol, which they saw on their\\r\\nright. None who then gazed on the fortifications ever dreamed of the\\r\\nmany, many weary months that would elapse, of the untold sufferings they\\r\\nwould have to endure, of the titanic struggle that would take place on\\r\\nthe very plain they were then crossing, or of the thousands of lives\\r\\nthat would be lost ere the British flag waved over that grim fortress.\\r\\nThe{203} troops made a tremendous march; never halting till, after sunset,\\r\\nthey reached the little hamlet of Tractir on the Tchernaya, where they\\r\\nhalted for the night.The next morning the march was resumed, and, crossing the Tchernaya, the\\r\\ncolumn, led by Lord Raglan, descended into the plain. They marched on,\\r\\nwith only one trifling hindrance from an old castle which stood on the\\r\\nheights, mounting a few old guns. The place was summoned, and at once\\r\\nsurrendered, when the troops took possession of it, and then marched at\\r\\nonce upon Balaclava.The thunder from guns in the little harbour announced the fact that the\\r\\nfleet had arrived, and the water was soon covered with British boats as\\r\\nthe town was filled with British soldiers. The cavalry were encamped\\r\\noutside the town, the infantry being accommodated in and around the\\r\\nplace.All that day and the next stragglers kept coming in, till General\\r\\nCathcart arriving safely with the rear-guard completed the success of\\r\\nthe famous ‘flank march.{204}’The little valley leading from the plain to the head of the harbour was\\r\\nfull of gardens, vineyards, and orchards. The streets of the town itself\\r\\nwere narrow and crooked; the houses built of loose stones, with wooden\\r\\nverandas and balconies. There were, however, one or two public buildings\\r\\nwhich were soon turned to account as hospitals and so on.The town of Sebastopol seemed to lie at the feet of the Allies, and many\\r\\nwondered why they did not walk in and drive out the Russian garrison;\\r\\nbut these forgot that the town was dominated by the forts and by the\\r\\nships in the harbour, and that although the Allies might get in easily\\r\\nenough they would be unable to remain there.The rumours of carrying the place by assault soon died away, and it\\r\\nbecame evident that a siege was{205} intended, though the place could not be\\r\\ncompletely invested. The task of landing siege-trains and stores was\\r\\nbegun, and these had to be hauled up six or seven miles from Balaclava\\r\\nto the front. There was an almost utter absence of wagons or horses, and\\r\\nevery old ammunition-cart and beast capable of work was pressed into the\\r\\nservice.From the fleet large numbers of sailors were landed, and these, with the\\r\\nreckless jollity and hearty go that distinguish sailors, dragged their\\r\\ngreat guns up into the batteries that were being formed. Often the\\r\\nship’s fiddler would sit astride the gun as his messmates hauled on to\\r\\nthe ropes, and to some chanty, with many strange phrases and nautical\\r\\nexpressions, dragged their guns along at a great pace. The infantry\\r\\nregiments were assigned to their different positions, and early in\\r\\nOctober the first trenches were opened.The Russians began to regain something of their confidence, and made\\r\\nseveral sorties at night, in some of which they achieved a measure of\\r\\nsuccess.Jack was kept busy with his regiment, amongst which, as amongst the rest\\r\\nof the army, cholera was still raging and claiming many victims.Enormous exertions were made by the French and British, and by the\\r\\nmiddle of October they had between them a hundred and twenty-six pieces\\r\\nof artillery in position.On the morning of the 17th, while Jack and his comrades were ‘standing\\r\\nto their horses’ as usual an hour before daybreak, with an absolutely\\r\\ndeafening roar the French and English batteries opened fire. The first\\r\\ngreat bombardment had begun. Every now and then a sixty-eight pound shot\\r\\ncame plump down{206} into the ground just behind the cavalry, who were\\r\\npresently dismissed to their lines.After breakfast Jack was sent with a letter to the officer commanding\\r\\nLord Raglan’s escort. The commander-in-chief had left Balaclava and\\r\\ntaken up his quarters in a snug farmhouse surrounded by vineyards and\\r\\noutbuildings, and situated about four miles from the town. Jack, having\\r\\ndelivered his letter, was told to wait, which he was very willing to do,\\r\\nfor he got a splendid view of the bombardment. He could see the\\r\\nLancaster and the mortar batteries in the right and left attacks, and\\r\\nthe French away on the left. The Russian gunners were plainly visible in\\r\\ntheir batteries, and they were maintaining a tremendous fire; while,\\r\\nfrom the harbour, shot and shell from the six hundred pieces of cannon\\r\\non the French and English fleets poured in their fire upon Sebastopol.The sight was grand—magnificent; the noise simply appalling. It seemed\\r\\nas if Sebastopol must crumble into dust beneath the fury of shot hurled\\r\\ninto it; but although nine batteries were destroyed the enemy still kept\\r\\nup a powerful resistance.Presently the fire, as though by mutual consent, slackened on both\\r\\nsides; then it broke out again with renewed fury. Suddenly a tremendous\\r\\nexplosion took place in one of the French batteries. Guns, carriages,\\r\\nparts of the embrasures, and upwards of a hundred men were blown to\\r\\nfragments. A magazine had been exploded. The Russians yelled with joy,\\r\\nand could be seen jumping on to their parapets, waving rammers in the\\r\\nair. The fire of the English batteries, though, soon gave them something\\r\\nelse to think about; but the fire of the French batteries{207} slackened and\\r\\nsoon their guns were almost silent. The French men-of-war, however,\\r\\nfired more furiously than ever, and so it went on till towards midday a\\r\\nsecond magazine was exploded in the French lines.Soon afterwards a tremendous explosion took place in the centre of\\r\\nSebastopol, doing immense damage, and later on the Redan was almost\\r\\nshattered by a similar explosion, and so the awful duel went on till\\r\\nnight, when both sides ceased from sheer weariness.The Allies had a loss together of about three hundred men, but they did\\r\\ninfinitely greater damage to the Russians, amongst others killing their\\r\\ngallant defender, Korniloff. After that, day by day, an almost incessant\\r\\nduel was kept up, the big guns roaring and thundering from morning till\\r\\nnight. Men were killed in the batteries and in the trenches daily, the\\r\\nlatter being most difficult to dig in the hard, stony ground. The earth\\r\\nfor gabions and sandbags had to be carried from a distance in baskets to\\r\\nthe place required, an arduous and dangerous work.But more deadly by far than the shot and shell of the enemy were the\\r\\nravages of the cholera, and in the first three weeks before Sebastopol\\r\\nthe army lost more men and officers than had fallen at the Alma—a\\r\\nterrible toll.[4] Balaclava was crowded with{208} invalids; hundreds were\\r\\nsent away daily to Scutari; yet more and more came, till they had to be\\r\\nleft dying in the streets for want of accommodation.Among the victims was St Arnaud, the French commander-in-chief, who was\\r\\nsucceeded by General Canrobert, a much abler man.The ‘Death or Glory Boys’ suffered with the others, and the regiment was\\r\\nonly a shadow of its former self. Captain Norreys being on the staff,\\r\\nand Major Willett ill at Balaclava, Captain Wintle was in command.‘What’s the use,’ growled Linham one morning when, after the usual hour\\r\\nof standing under arms, the cavalry had been dismissed for\\r\\nbreakfast—‘what’s the use of bringing cavalry to a place like this I\\r\\nwant to know?’‘Well, I’ve got cause enough here,’ said Linham. ‘Seven months’\\r\\ncampaigning, and never anything for us to do that a militiaman on a\\r\\ndonkey couldn’t have done as well. Sent to the most unhealthy{209} places\\r\\nthey could find, and, to wind up with, a prospect of winter under canvas\\r\\nin a hole like this with nothing to do but escort sick and wounded or\\r\\nhaul stores up from Balaclava. What’s the use of cavalry here, that’s\\r\\nwhat I want to know.’‘Never mind, sergeant, I’ll get you a cup of coffee made directly,’ said\\r\\nJack as he unsaddled Dainty.Jack took a pail and went off to the river for the water. Several others\\r\\nwere bent on the same errand, and all had filled their buckets and were\\r\\non their way back to the camp when suddenly there was a shrill, horrible\\r\\nscreaming overhead, and something fell with a crash just in front of\\r\\nthem.In an instant there was a blinding flash, a terrific roar, and the earth\\r\\nseemed almost to quake. For a few seconds no one moved; then,\\r\\nhalf-dazed, they raised up their heads and slowly got on their feet.\\r\\nJack found he was drenched with water from his pail and covered with\\r\\nearth, otherwise he was not hurt, nor were any of the others; but his\\r\\npail had disappeared, having been blown clean away. In front of them was\\r\\na hole big enough to have buried a horse in.‘A bit too close,’ said Jack; ‘but I must have some water. Will any one\\r\\nlend me enough from his pail to fill our pot?’‘Come back with me and help to fill mine again,{210} chum,’ said the Hussar,\\r\\n‘and I’ll give you some out of it.’Jack’s pot was thus filled, and presently he sat down beside the fire\\r\\nWill had managed to make, and thought for a moment over his escape.‘What’s up, Jack? You look as solemn as if you were going to your own\\r\\nfuneral,’ said Will, who was trying to roast some green coffee-berries\\r\\non a mess-tin.‘Whew!’ whistled Will, ‘that’s too near to be pleasant. I thought I\\r\\nheard a shell pass pretty close. But give me a hand with the grinding,\\r\\nwill you?’The scorched berries were put into a piece of an old exploded five-inch\\r\\nshell, and then with a couple of nine-pounder balls the trumpeters\\r\\ncrushed them up, finally emptying them into the pot when the water\\r\\nboiled. They at last succeeded in making a greasy sort of\\r\\nbrowny-coloured liquid, having fragments of berries floating about on\\r\\nthe top of it, and this, with some hard biscuit, was to form their\\r\\nbreakfast.They had hardly, however, tasted this beverage, which, poor stuff that\\r\\nit was, was more than welcome, when bang! bang! rang out a couple of\\r\\ncarbines.All jumped to their feet, and Pearson, looking down the valley, said,\\r\\n‘There’s something up, the vedettes are retiring and circling left, and\\r\\nhere comes an orderly.’A Dragoon was seen coming towards the light cavalry camp at full gallop;\\r\\nthen the trumpets in the heavy cavalry camp were heard sounding\\r\\nboot-{211}and-saddle, and the Scots Greys with a troop of horse artillery\\r\\nwere seen galloping to the front.The guns in the Turkish redoubts opened fire and the trumpets of the\\r\\nlight cavalry sounded boot-and-saddle.Jack and Will took up the call, and in a few minutes Lancers and Hussars\\r\\nwere trotting down the valley, leaving their breakfast behind them.When they arrived at the Turkish redoubts it was seen that a large body\\r\\nof Russian infantry had debouched from the ravine and taken up a\\r\\nposition some two thousand yards away on the left front. Cossacks\\r\\nappeared on the ridges, and it seemed as if an advance were intended. A\\r\\ncouple of hours passed however, and nothing further happened, then the\\r\\nEnglish cavalry returned, all but one regiment which remained watching\\r\\nthe enemy, being relieved in a couple of hours by another one.Sergeant Linham cursed the Russians most heartily. ‘It’s just one of\\r\\ntheir dirty tricks,’ he said, ‘to keep us hanging about in the saddle\\r\\nfor two or three hours, cold and starving, then to draw off, doing\\r\\nnothing.’At night the watch-fires of the Russians could be plainly seen, and the\\r\\ncavalry were kept under arms; but in the morning the enemy had entirely\\r\\ndisappeared, a fact about which there were a good many things Sergeant\\r\\nLinham ‘wanted to know.{212}’Sergeant Barrymore, Jack, Brandon, Pearson, and the others of the\\r\\nrelief, wrapped in their cloaks, were huddling round the fire and\\r\\nblessing their luck in being out on such a nasty night, when a jingle of\\r\\nspurs was heard and a rough voice cried, ‘Ha, hum! not much trouble to\\r\\nsurprise this picket, I’m thinking;’ and Sergeant Linham stepped into\\r\\nthe circle of firelight.‘First, my legs; second, I’m not feeling sleepy; third, I got a bottle\\r\\nof rum down in Balaclava to-day from a friend of mine in the\\r\\ncommissariat; so I thought a tot round would be welcome to you.’‘Forward, true friend and comrade,’ said Brandon, ‘for has it not been\\r\\nwritten: “Wine maketh glad the heart of man”?’‘You’ve got a quotation for everything, Frank?’ said Pearson; ‘you’re\\r\\nlike an encyclopædia with the covers off.{213}’‘Blair, throw on another handful of roots and put the pot on,’ said\\r\\nBarrymore to Jack.—‘And, Jimmy, sit down by me and uncork your bottle.’‘Frank, why on earth did you enlist?’ asked Pearson. ‘With your\\r\\neducation and talents I should have thought you would have found life\\r\\neasier as an actor, for which life you seem entirely fitted, than as a\\r\\nprivate of Lancers, risking his life every minute of the day in the\\r\\nCrimea for a shilling a day.’Whenever Brandon was asked a question he did not care about answering he\\r\\nalways turned it aside in some jesting manner, or gave the conversation\\r\\nanother turn. Looking at the buttons on the sleeve of his tunic, he\\r\\nsaid, ‘Who on earth gave the regiment this gruesome badge of grinning\\r\\nskull and becrossed shin-bones?’‘That I can tell you,’ replied Barrymore. ‘The regiment was raised by\\r\\none John Hale, colonel of the 47th Foot. He was the officer who brought\\r\\nhome{214} the news of Wolfe’s victory at Quebec and of his death. To\\r\\ncommemorate the latter, the 17th were raised, and in his memory the\\r\\nskull and cross-bones was made the badge of the regiment. It was at\\r\\nfirst worn on the left breast of the scarlet tunic, and though the\\r\\nuniform has been several times changed the badge has always remained the\\r\\nsame.’Reference to the grim regimental badge seemed to have a depressing\\r\\neffect on Brandon, who lapsed into silence.Brandon—who half-sat, half-lay on the ground beside Jack—fell into a\\r\\nfitful slumber, but presently started in his sleep and muttered, ‘Skull\\r\\nand cross-bones—good badge—nothing to live for—I will go’—— He\\r\\nturned uneasily; then added, ‘All skeletons’—— when the voice of\\r\\nBarrymore, bidding the next relief mount, roused him up.The men departed, and the relieved men came in reporting all quiet. The\\r\\nnight passed, the rain leaving off and the moon coming out. Presently\\r\\nthe cold, gray dawn broke, and Jack was just off to try and find some\\r\\nmore wood for the fire when, looking up, he chanced to glance across to\\r\\nthe height on his right, known as Canrobert’s Hill. Instantly he noticed\\r\\nthat instead of one there were two flags flying.‘Danger, Jack; look at the vedettes.’ And Jack, looking, saw that they\\r\\nwere ‘circling right and left at a trot,’ thus signalling the advance of\\r\\nboth cavalry and infantry, and at a quick pace.{215}‘Look over towards the second redoubt!’ cried Pearson; ‘there’s some of\\r\\nthe staff, I can see the cocked hats.’‘If there’s going to be a scrimmage we must be in it,’ said Barry more\\r\\njoyfully; ‘we’ve heard enough about being do-nothings. If we get a\\r\\nchance to-day we’ll show ’em.’Just then the boom of a twelve-pounder gun in the redoubt before them\\r\\nrang out. It was the warning note, announcing, though no one knew it\\r\\nthen, that the day of the cavalry had arrived. It was the morn of\\r\\nBalaclava!{216}An enormous force of Russians, horse, foot, and artillery, was advancing\\r\\nupon Balaclava, they said. After events showed that twenty-five\\r\\nbattalions, thirty-four squadrons, and seventy-eight guns, nearly\\r\\ntwenty-five thousand men in all, was the actual number.The guns from the Turkish redoubts were quickly replied to by a\\r\\ntremendous fire from several Russian batteries. The picket was ordered\\r\\nto fall back towards the camp.The whole of the Light Brigade had stood to their horses an hour before\\r\\ndaybreak as usual, and had just received the command, ‘File to your\\r\\nlines!’ when the guns of No. 1 Redoubt opened fire. They immediately\\r\\nreceived orders to mount and advance, meeting Jack’s troop on their way.\\r\\nThe whole were then halted with a troop of horse artillery, just to the\\r\\nright of No. 3 Redoubt, under the southern slopes of the Causeway\\r\\nHeights. Here they got a good view of what was going on.On their right front dense masses of Russians, having silenced with\\r\\ntheir artillery the guns in No. 1{217} Redoubt, were advancing to the\\r\\nattack, while other columns were preparing to storm Canrobert’s Hill. On\\r\\ntheir right flank was Balaclava, the slight defence in front of it being\\r\\nheld by the Royal Marines, a hill to the left of Kadikoi being crested\\r\\nby Sir Colin Campbell with the 93rd Highlanders. The heavy cavalry was\\r\\non the right of the Light Brigade. The Fedioukine Hills on the left\\r\\nfront, across the Woronzoff Road, were crowded with Russian infantry and\\r\\ncavalry, while Lord Raglan with his staff had taken up a position to the\\r\\nleft rear on the Sapoune Ridge.Jack had hardly time to take in all these details when a sort of\\r\\nguttural yell in front, accompanied by crashing volleys of musketry,\\r\\nannounced the fact that the Russian infantry were attacking the redoubt.Captain Maude’s troop of horse artillery opened fire on the Russians and\\r\\nmaintained it for some time. Presently the Lancers saw on their flank a\\r\\nstretcher being carried by. On it, horribly wounded, lay the gallant\\r\\nCaptain Maude. Soon the ammunition of the horse battery was exhausted,\\r\\nand it had to retire till the ammunition wagons should arrive.By that time the Russians were swarming across the ditch and over the\\r\\nfeeble parapet of No. 1 Redoubt. The Russians outnumbered the Turks by\\r\\nten to one, yet the latter maintained an obstinate bayonet-fight until\\r\\nsheer weight of numbers crushed the Turks and they fled, or at least\\r\\nabout a third of them did. Two-thirds they left dead—for the Russians\\r\\ncould be depended upon to slay all the wounded—in the fort behind them.‘Ha, hum! they won’t bolt far,’ said Sergeant Lin{218}ham grimly; and as he\\r\\nspoke the Russian artillery opened on them; then a cloud of Cossacks\\r\\npursued them and speared many a hapless Moslem.Jack bit his lip. ‘It’s galling to sit here and see one’s allies\\r\\nbutchered before one’s face,’ he said. ‘Why don’t they let us go out and\\r\\ncover the retreat of these poor wretches?’‘Besides, why should we bother about these cowardly Turks?’ said\\r\\nPearson. ‘Why don’t they stick to their guns?’‘They’ve stuck pretty well to ’em, I think,’ replied Linham. ‘They\\r\\nfought till it was quite clear we either could not or would not support\\r\\nthem, and to have stopped longer would have been sheer madness.’An enormous body of cavalry advanced down the valley, covering the\\r\\nadvance of seven battalions and several batteries. These latter soon\\r\\nopened fire on the other forts, the guns from the captured No. 1 Redoubt\\r\\nbeing directed against No. 2.The Turks, realising that the English cavalry was unable to support\\r\\nthem, did not wait for the attack which the Russian infantry was seen to\\r\\nbe preparing to make upon them, and were soon scuttling out of the forts\\r\\nand retreating towards Balaclava. The Light Brigade was advanced to\\r\\ncover their retreat.‘No, the fate of their comrades in No. 1 Fort seems to have given ’em\\r\\nthe funks. They’ve actually deserted the guns, and left their colours\\r\\ntoo.’‘They seem more anxious about their personal{219} belongings than anything\\r\\nelse,’ said Jack; ‘just look at the beggars, surely those are pots and\\r\\npans some of them are carrying.’‘So it is,’ laughed Brandon; ‘and look at that white-bearded old sinner,\\r\\nhe’s actually carrying a bed on his back.’This was the case, and the Turks began to pour from the forts towards\\r\\nthe English cavalry, many crying loudly, ‘Ship, ship!’‘I’ll give yez ship, ye dhirty blackguards,’ cried an Irish trooper of\\r\\nthe 8th Hussars, belabouring with the flat of his sword a man who ran\\r\\npast him crying loudly, his frying-pan and pot banging and jangling\\r\\nbehind him.One of the last to leave the redoubts was an English artilleryman who\\r\\nhad been detailed to show the Turks how to use the guns. He had a narrow\\r\\nescape of his life from the enemy’s cavalry, and as he ran towards a few\\r\\nmen of Jack’s troop who had been sent out to cover his retreat he\\r\\npanted, ‘The Bono Johnnies left me in the lurch. Anyhow, the guns of No.\\r\\n4 Fort won’t be turned against you, for I spiked ’em before I left.’Had the Turks spiked the other guns before they bolted it would have\\r\\nsaved much unnecessary loss of life and have robbed the Russians of much\\r\\nof their vaunted victory when, next day, they paraded the captured guns\\r\\nin Sebastopol.The flight of the Turks was ultimately arrested, and they were persuaded\\r\\nto form up in a wobbly line on the left of the 93rd Highlanders, who\\r\\nunder old Sir Colin lined the heights outside Balaclava.{220}Round shot from the forts now began to fall in amongst the Light\\r\\nBrigade, and several horses were hit.‘This is the part of fighting I don’t like,’ said Jack; ‘this sitting\\r\\nstill and being fired at. Why on earth don’t they let us do something?’‘Ha, hum! don’t be impatient,’ growled Sergeant Linham, who it was noted\\r\\nlooked remarkably smart that morning; ‘you’ll have work to do\\r\\npresently.’Bullets began to whistle about their ears from the dense battalions in\\r\\nfront, and presently the order was given to retire farther down the\\r\\nvalley. The battle now appeared to lull; it almost seemed as if the\\r\\nRussians, having captured the forts, did not know what to do next. The\\r\\norder was given for the Light Brigade to dismount, and many men lit\\r\\ntheir pipes.‘If the Russians had any go about them,’ said Pearson, ‘with the\\r\\nenormous numbers they’ve got they might advance and sweep us all into\\r\\nthe sea before any help could arrive from our fellows before\\r\\nSebastopol.’‘It’s a good thing for us they haven’t any go, then,’ said Jack.\\r\\n‘Anyway, I wish I had a bit of biscuit, for I’m jolly hungry.’‘I’m simply ravenous,’ said Linham, ‘and so are all the regiment; not\\r\\none of us has had bit or drop this morning.’Time passed, and the cavalry remained inactive, while enormous masses of\\r\\nRussians crept rather than marched up the valley. Batteries could be\\r\\nseen taking up their position on the Fedioukine Heights, while between\\r\\nthree and four thousand cavalry, Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons, came\\r\\nsteadily forward. Then several batteries were seen to be advancing so{221}\\r\\nas to open fire on Sir Colin Campbell and his Highlanders.‘Good heavens!’ muttered Captain Wintle, who was just by Jack, ‘if they\\r\\nsucceed in defeating the Scotsmen—and how can they help it with such\\r\\nnumbers—nothing can save Balaclava, and our base and all our stores are\\r\\ngone.’He trotted up to Lord Paget, who in the absence of Lord Cardigan, still\\r\\naboard his yacht, was in command. He and Captain Wintle spoke for a few\\r\\nseconds; then Captain Wintle trotted back, crying out to Jack, ‘Follow\\r\\nme, corporal.’In an instant Jack was in the saddle and trotting after his officer.\\r\\nIncreasing their pace to a gallop, they went by the inner line of\\r\\ndefence held by the Marines, and were going on towards the town when\\r\\nthey met about forty Guardsmen under a young officer marching out.‘Hallo, Verschoyle,’ cried Captain Wintle, ‘I was just coming in to beat\\r\\nup every man who can fire a musket. The Russians evidently mean to\\r\\nattack the town, and there are only Turks and the Highlanders to hold it\\r\\ntill reinforcements come down from the plain.’‘We’ve seen that, Wintle, and I and my men are off to join the 93rd.\\r\\nColonel Davenant is just behind with a hundred invalids. Come with us\\r\\nand see the fun!’Captain Wintle rode beside the gallant young Guardsman, and they soon\\r\\nreached Sir Colin, who with a grim smile told Verschoyle to take\\r\\nposition on the left of the 93rd. The hundred invalids, men of all\\r\\nregiments, a pale and sickly crowd, who were waiting at Balaclava to\\r\\nembark, soon after arriving took up their position on the left of the\\r\\nGuards.{222}Jack had kept close to Captain Wintle, and reaching the top of the ridge\\r\\nhe saw the great mass of Russian cavalry still advancing. Presently some\\r\\nsquadrons detached themselves and shaped their way towards the\\r\\nHighlanders. These, on account of some casualties they had already\\r\\nsuffered from the enemy’s artillery, had retired behind the crest of the\\r\\nhill and lay down.No sooner was the cavalry seen advancing than Sir Colin gave a brisk\\r\\norder, and the Highlanders sprang up and lined the crest. The advancing\\r\\ncavalry seemed hardly to have expected to see infantry; but they came\\r\\nsteadily on, when, as though by common consent, the two battalions of\\r\\nTurks turned and fled.This was a serious defection, and it at once became evident to that\\r\\n‘thin red line’ crowning the hillock in front of Kadikoi that on them,\\r\\nand on them alone, rested the fate of Balaclava.Sir Colin Campbell saw and understood the situation in a moment, and the\\r\\nstern old warrior rode down the lines and said, ‘Men, the safety of\\r\\nBalaclava rests on you. There is no retreat from here. You must die\\r\\nwhere you stand!’The Highlanders’ faces lit up; they set their lips, their eyes gleamed,\\r\\nand from between their clenched teeth came the words in a sort of\\r\\nominous growl,’Ay, ay, Sir Colin, we’ll do that.’The Russian cavalry resumed their advance, and some of the Highlanders\\r\\nin their wild impetuosity would have rushed down upon their foe; but the\\r\\nangry voice of the chief rang out, ‘93rd—93rd, hang all that\\r\\nimpetuosity!’Then the Russian Hussars, gay troops in sky-blue,{223} with yellow and\\r\\nsilver lace, came within range, and the Highlanders and others, standing\\r\\nonly in double rank, delivered a withering volley which emptied many a\\r\\nsaddle. The enemy staggered, but still came on, when a second volley\\r\\ncrashed into them. Then the horsemen halted and wheeled as though to\\r\\ntake the gallant red-coats in flank; but one company of the Highlanders\\r\\nbrought up their left shoulders, and again delivered a volley, on which\\r\\nthe gay Hussars broke and retired downhill in confusion, followed by the\\r\\nfire of the English artillery and the cheers from the ‘Thin Red Line.’They had reached the site of the light cavalry camp, some of the tents\\r\\nbeing already taken down, while others remained standing, when Captain\\r\\nWintle, actuated by a sudden impulse, said, ‘Dismount, corporal, and run\\r\\nto my tent—that one yonder. Inside is a bottle of brandy. I’ll fill my\\r\\ncanteen with it.’Jack went inside the tent indicated, found the bottle, poured some into\\r\\nhis officer’s water-bottle, and, as he was bidden, poured the rest into\\r\\nhis own. He then mounted again and both were making their way to where\\r\\nthe Light Brigade still stood dismounted, when just behind them, picking\\r\\ntheir way among the remains of the camp, they saw the heavy Dragoons\\r\\nadvancing.Gray-headed old General Scarlett, followed by his aide-de-camp\\r\\nLieutenant Elliot, led the Inniskillings, who were advancing by\\r\\n‘threes.’‘They don’t want any support, General;’ and in a few words Captain\\r\\nWintle related their gallant action.Lieutenant Elliot had been riding beside the General as he talked, and\\r\\nJack was just behind. They were marching parallel with the Causeway\\r\\nHeights and about eight hundred yards from the summit, when Jack\\r\\nhappened to glance up, and in a moment noticed the top fringed with\\r\\nlance-points.He immediately called out the fact, and Lieutenant Elliot, who had seen\\r\\nmuch service, said, ‘The trumpeter’s right, and, moreover, those troops\\r\\nare fronting towards the south valley and will take us in flank as we\\r\\npass them.’General Scarlett, who had seen no war-service, had the greatest\\r\\nconfidence in his aide-de-camp who had, and he said instantly, ‘Elliot,\\r\\nought we not to charge them?’Behind the squadron of Inniskillings were two of the Scots Greys, and\\r\\nthese formed up on the left of the column. The 4th and 5th Dragoon\\r\\nGuards and the Royals were following, making, with the other squadron of\\r\\nthe Inniskillings, eight squadrons in all; but Scarlett had with him at\\r\\nthe moment but three, the gallant ‘Three Hundred.’Hardly had the General announced his determination of charging the enemy\\r\\nthan they came over the ridge and began to descend the slope, an\\r\\nenormous mass, nearly forty squadrons of Lancers, Hussars, Dragoons, and\\r\\nCossacks, all, with the exception of one Hussar corps in pale-blue, clad\\r\\nin dark-gray overcoats, which seemed to be the distinguishing badge of\\r\\nRussian troops.{226}Seeing the handful of red-coated Dragoons below them, they started\\r\\nforward at a smart canter. Greys and Inniskillings, however, were going\\r\\non calmly with dressing their line, the officers facing their men and\\r\\nseeing that the line was dressed with nicety. Captain Wintle had\\r\\nremained near General Scarlett, and Jack remained with his officer.The advancing Russians—seeing the calmness with which the British\\r\\ncavalry prepared for the attack, apparently ignoring the fact that the\\r\\nenemy was in sight—as though fearing an ambush, slackened their pace to\\r\\na trot, then to a walk, then halted altogether.‘Will you lead the charge, or will you direct, sir?’ asked Lieutenant\\r\\nElliot of his chief, saluting with his sword.‘I shall lead, by all means,’ said the gallant old General. ‘Lord Lucan\\r\\nis on the ground and in supreme command; as its brigadier I will lead my\\r\\nbrigade.’The Inniskillings were eager to be off, and several men seemed inclined\\r\\nto start; but the General waved them back, saying, ‘Back, men; the Greys\\r\\nare not ready.’When the line was dressed to his satisfaction, the General, ignoring the\\r\\nintermediate steps of trot, canter, and gallop, said simply to his\\r\\ntrumpeter, ‘Sound the charge;’ and as the notes rang out the squadrons\\r\\nstarted forward.Captain Wintle rode behind the General, and Jack followed him, keeping\\r\\nalmost in a line with General Scarlett’s trumpeter and orderly. The\\r\\nGeneral himself, mounted on an immense bay horse, was fully fifty yards\\r\\nin front. No matter what happened, he was determined to be first among\\r\\nthe enemy.{227}These, with a precision that showed they were highly trained troops, had\\r\\nthrown out two huge wings on either flank as though, when the Dragoons\\r\\nhad passed, to close in on them and cut off their retreat. From the\\r\\nstart the distance was only about four hundred yards; but at first the\\r\\npace was slow, owing to the litter of the camp over which they moved.The Russian cavalry had a depth of fully twenty files and a frontage\\r\\nthrice that of the handful of heavy Dragoons, every man of whom knew\\r\\nthat it was absolutely impossible to hurl such a mass back by mere\\r\\nshock; all they could hope to do was to carve their way in and to ply\\r\\ntheir swords until they fell. This was all they asked.As the Inniskillings neared the enemy they gave a wild cheer; but the\\r\\nGreys came more silently, though their faces were lit up with the stern\\r\\njoy of war. An officer sat in front of the Russian squadrons, and\\r\\nGeneral Scarlett, passing him on his left, hewed his way into the\\r\\nserried masses behind. The General’s aide-de-camp rode straight at the\\r\\nRussian officer, and, parrying a cut made at him, drove his sword up to\\r\\nthe hilt in the Russian’s body. For a moment he could not withdraw it,\\r\\nand clinging to the hilt he turned the wounded Russian round and\\r\\nliterally tore him from his saddle. He then disappeared into the mass,\\r\\nas did the orderly and trumpeter, and Jack found himself face to face\\r\\nwith the foe.A trumpeter, probably obeying some order, was sounding a call, and had\\r\\nturned his head towards his comrades while doing so. As Dainty raced by\\r\\nhim Jack raised his sword to cut this trumpeter from his saddle; but\\r\\nseeing the man was unable to protect himself he stayed his hand, and\\r\\ndashed at the Hussars{228} behind. The two Russians who faced him forced\\r\\ntheir horses to right and left, and left Jack a space, into which he\\r\\nurged his horse. He made a tremendous cut at the Hussar on his right as\\r\\nhe did so, and the man reeled in his saddle. The other man, though, made\\r\\na point which Jack parried; and, his horse still going forward between\\r\\nthe files, he found himself surrounded by enemies. For a few seconds\\r\\nthat half-dozen intrepid cavalrymen were alone amidst thousands of\\r\\nRussians; then came a wild yell, a crashing shock, and the first line of\\r\\nInniskillings and Greys had reached the foe.Jack was forced farther in, being absolutely surrounded by blue jackets\\r\\nand gray greatcoats. Blows were rained at him; but by keeping up a rapid\\r\\ncircling of his own blade above his head he managed to ward them off.\\r\\nAnother crash behind told that the second rank had charged in, and the\\r\\nforward movement of that handful of red-coats became accelerated.The Russians did not directly face their enemies, but always gave way to\\r\\nright and left, as much as they could, before them; then they closed in\\r\\non the flanks and behind, and tried to cut the Englishmen from their\\r\\nsaddles. But the heavy Dragoons were men of fine physique, larger,\\r\\nheavier, and better mounted than the Russians, and their blows told with\\r\\nterrible effect.Fierce denunciations and epithets of disdain were hurled at the foe by\\r\\nIrishman and Scot as they hacked and hewed; but the Russians, with lips\\r\\ncurled back from their clenched teeth, made only a sort of gurgling roar\\r\\nor a low kind of hissing noise. The turf beneath the horses’ hoofs was\\r\\nthick and spongy and deadened the sound of the trampling of thousands of\\r\\nhoofs;{229} but the ceaseless clash of sabres, the frequent firing of\\r\\npistols, the incessant jingle of cavalry accoutrements made such a\\r\\nvolume of sound as must have been heard by the headquarter staff up on\\r\\nthe heights above.Jack had hewed his way half-through the dense mass, and had got in\\r\\namongst some Dragoons, on whose thick gray coats a sword-blade fell\\r\\nquite harmless. The men wore tall red felt shakos with a brass eagle in\\r\\nfront, and several of them closed round Jack with the intention of\\r\\nslaying him. One fellow made two blows in rapid succession, and while\\r\\nJack was parrying these another made a thrust at his head. Fortunately,\\r\\nhis aim was too high, and though he pierced the top of Jack’s lance-cap\\r\\nhe missed his head. That man fell back with his sword-hand almost\\r\\nsevered by Jack’s sword.The other three, however, uttering their curious zizzing sound through\\r\\ntheir clenched teeth, renewed the attack, and a blow fell on Jack’s left\\r\\nshoulder which almost knocked him from the saddle. Fortunately for him\\r\\nthe aim had not been true, and the flat rather than the edge of the\\r\\nRussian’s blade struck him. As it was he reeled, and next moment must\\r\\nhave been struck from his saddle, to have been trampled to death by\\r\\nhundreds of horses; but a sergeant of the Greys cut his way to him, and\\r\\nwith three tremendous successive strokes cut down the Russians attacking\\r\\nhim.The pressure thus relaxed, Jack paused a moment to take breath and look\\r\\nround him. It looked like a vast sea of gray coats and Russian faces.\\r\\nHere and there a tall bearskin or burnished helmet could be seen, and an\\r\\noccasional gleam of a scarlet tunic; but{230} in that throng of Russians\\r\\nthey appeared buried. A mighty swaying, heaving motion had become\\r\\nimparted to the mass, and it was no longer possible to direct one’s way.But at that moment a tremendous cheer was heard from behind, and the 5th\\r\\nDragoon Guards came crashing in. A moment later another cheer, a good,\\r\\nhearty English one, and the Royals rolled up one of the wheeling wings.\\r\\nThen the 4th Dragoon Guards in grand style charged in on the Russian\\r\\nright flank, and the three fresh regiments carved a gory way to the aid\\r\\nof their comrades of the Greys and Inniskillings.The Russians were pierced and riven, the swaying motion set in upwards,\\r\\nand the enormous mass, incredible as it seemed, began to fall back\\r\\nbefore the fiery impetuosity of the British Dragoons.The adjutant of the Greys, a mighty man with a mighty voice, was calling\\r\\nupon his men, ‘Rally, the Greys! Rally, rally! Rally on me!’Another officer, minus his bearskin, his face streaming with blood,\\r\\nthough he seemed unaware of it, joined the adjutant, and the men began\\r\\nto rally on the Russian flank.A trumpeter of the Greys was near Jack, when an officer, whose burnished\\r\\nhelmet was cloven down to his head, laid a hand on Jack’s shoulder,\\r\\ncrying, ‘Trumpeter, sound the rally!’Jack and the Scots Grey sounded again and again. Men of different\\r\\nregiments rallied, formed, and at a word from an officer of the Royals,\\r\\nwith a cheer charged once more upon the enemy. Taken now in{231} flank,\\r\\npressed hard from in front, smitten on all sides by the mighty\\r\\nscarlet-clad Dragoons, the Russians broke, the movement uphill got more\\r\\npronounced, they turned their horses’ heads, and soon the thousands were\\r\\ngalloping up the hill whence but ten minutes before they had come down\\r\\nin all the majesty of overwhelming numbers.Royals, Greys, and Inniskillings would have pursued; but the officers\\r\\nknew that once upon the crest of the Causeway Heights they would become\\r\\nexposed to a galling fire of musketry and artillery.‘Rally, rally, rally!’ shouted officers and sergeants; ‘Rally, rally!’\\r\\nwent the bugles, and the scarlet coats were got in hand, while a British\\r\\nfield-battery and a battery of position opened fire on the defeated\\r\\nRussians and hastened their retirement.As the Dragoons reformed a thundering roar of cheering went up from the\\r\\nthroats of all those comrades who had beheld their gallant deed.An aide-de-camp came down from Lord Raglan to Scarlett, bearing the\\r\\nhastily scribbled words, ‘Well done!’‘Greys, gallant Greys,’ he said, ‘I am sixty-one years old, and if I\\r\\nwere young again I should be proud to serve in your ranks.’Such praise from such a man raised the enthusiasm of his countrymen, and\\r\\nthey gave him a cheer that brought the colour to his cheeks.Jack was cheering as loudly as any one when he felt himself tapped on\\r\\nthe shoulder, and, turning, saw Captain Wintle, his reeking sword in his\\r\\nhand, regarding him sternly.{232}‘Then follow me back to our brigade, or Lord Cardigan will have\\r\\nsomething to say to both you and me;’ and setting spurs to their horses\\r\\nthe two Lancers galloped across the heights to where the Light Brigade\\r\\nsat, some five hundred yards away.{233}Lord Cardigan had by that time come up from his yacht in Balaclava\\r\\nharbour, and had taken over the command. He sat in front of his brigade,\\r\\nsavagely gnawing his moustache.Captain Norreys, on seeing that his regiment was likely to go into\\r\\naction, had instantly asked for and obtained permission from Lord Raglan\\r\\nto take over the command. Still in his staff tunic and undress cap, he\\r\\nsat in front of the regiment; but as Jack and Captain Wintle rode up he\\r\\nspurred to Lord Cardigan’s side and spoke earnestly to him.‘My lord,’ said Captain Norreys, ‘we should advance at once; we could\\r\\ncut off the enemy’s cavalry and convert their retreat into a rout.’‘No, no, Norreys,’ replied Lord Cardigan angrily. ‘My orders are\\r\\npositive, to hold this position and on no account to leave it.’‘But, my lord, such an opportunity creates a different situation. It’s\\r\\nclearly our duty to charge,{234} and through doing so we need not fail to\\r\\nhold this position.’‘Once and for all, no! Retire to your regiment, sir! I will obey my\\r\\norders, though those confounded heavies have the laugh of us this day.’Captain Norreys saluted, and biting his lips with anger and vexation\\r\\nretired, noticing Captain Wintle as he did so.‘You, at least, have had a chance,’ he said. ‘We are committing a\\r\\nfrightful blunder by remaining here, through the ignorance of our chief.\\r\\nHis obstinate adherence to the very letter of an order he does not\\r\\nunderstand will cost us dear.’Alas! a still more deplorable misconception of orders by his superior\\r\\nofficer was shortly to send two-thirds of the light cavalry to their\\r\\ndoom.The colonel of the 8th Hussars had been speaking to Lord Cardigan; and\\r\\nLarry, as the colonel’s orderly trumpeter, was with him, the two passing\\r\\nclose by Jack as they started back to their regiment. Larry reined in a\\r\\nmoment.‘Jack, ye’ve just all the luck in the wurrld,’ he said; ‘ye’ve been in\\r\\nthe finest charge since Waterloo, and here are we, sitting still, eating\\r\\nour hearts out wid envy.’‘Our turn may come yet, Larry,’ said Jack, shaking his warm-hearted\\r\\nfriend’s hand; and then he took his place in the ranks, telling Pearson\\r\\nand the others round what he had seen of the heavy cavalry charge.Presently Pearson said, ‘Hallo, what’s up. There’s an aide-de-camp from\\r\\nheadquarters jawing old Lucan,{235}’All turned and saw an officer in Hussar uniform, the impetuous Captain\\r\\nNolan, talking vehemently to Lord Lucan, waving his arm and pointing\\r\\nstraight up the north valley to where the Russians had a battery of\\r\\ntwelve guns posted. They talked some time; then both Lord Lucan and\\r\\nCaptain Nolan rode over to Lord Cardigan and a further conversation\\r\\noccurred. They spoke loudly, and the front-rank men of the 17th could\\r\\nhear distinctly some of the conversation.‘Certainly, sir; but allow me to point out to you that the Russians have\\r\\na battery in the valley on our front, and batteries and Riflemen on each\\r\\nflank,’ they heard Lord Cardigan say.Lord Lucan shrugged his shoulders and replied, ‘I cannot help it; Lord\\r\\nRaglan will have it so. We have no choice but to obey. When I asked\\r\\nCaptain Nolan what we were to attack, he pointed up the valley with his\\r\\nsword, and said in an insulting manner, “There, my lord, is your enemy;\\r\\nthere are your guns.”’‘Enough, my lord,’ answered Lord Cardigan quietly, saluting with his\\r\\nsword. Then turning and facing his men he said, ‘The brigade will\\r\\nadvance.’Lord Lucan first ordered the 11th Hussars back, leaving the 17th Lancers\\r\\nand 13th Light Dragoons in the front rank, 11th Hussars and 4th Light\\r\\nDragoons in the second, and the 8th Hussars in the rear rank. These\\r\\ndispositions were made quietly and orderly; the lines were dressed, and\\r\\nthe squadron, troop, and serrafile leaders took up their positions.Lord Cardigan called Lord Paget, the colonel of the 4th Light Dragoons,\\r\\nto him, and said, ‘My lord, I want you to give me your best\\r\\nsupport—mind, your best support.{236}’Lord Paget saluted his superior, saying, ‘You may rely upon me, my\\r\\nlord,’ and retired to his regiment.Lord Cardigan then placed himself about five horses’ length in front of\\r\\nhis brigade, saying to Trumpeter Brittain of the 17th, who was his\\r\\norderly, ‘Sound the trot,’ and the brigade moved off.Jack was behind Captain Wintle; on his right was Cornet Leland, and just\\r\\nbehind him were Brandon, Pearson, and Williams. Will was with Captain\\r\\nNorreys in front. The men were in high spirits, though all realised the\\r\\ndesperate venture on which they were about to be launched.‘We’ll show ’em to-day whether cavalry are any good or not,’ said\\r\\nPearson, as he gripped his lance firmly.‘Ha, hum!’ sounded a voice from behind, ‘ye’ll be better keeping your\\r\\nbreath, you toads. Use your arms more and your tongues less; we’ve got a\\r\\nlong way to go;’ and Sergeant Linham blew violently down his nose.Most of them there were going on the longest journey of all—the last,\\r\\nlong journey from whence none return.They had not proceeded very far when some shouting was heard from\\r\\nbehind; a hoarse command to some one to halt it seemed. Jack turned his\\r\\nhead and beheld a strange sight. Private Veigh, the regimental butcher,\\r\\nclad only in shirt and overalls, the former blood-stained, mounted on a\\r\\nwhite horse, a black clay-pipe in his mouth, a sword in his hand, was\\r\\nforcing his way into his proper place in the{237} ranks. He had been busy\\r\\nkilling oxen, when, hearing the trumpets of the Light Brigade sounding\\r\\nthe advance, he had seized a sword, jumped bareback on the first horse\\r\\nhe could see, and joined his troop.‘If the old 17th’s going into action I’m going with it,’ he said, and in\\r\\nspite of the positive orders of his officers to retire he insisted on\\r\\nremaining, and went on with his regiment.They had got some little distance up the valley when Captain Nolan, who\\r\\nhad announced his intention of charging with the brigade, and had taken\\r\\nup his position on the left flank, was seen spurring wildly forward,\\r\\nadvancing diagonally across their front, waving his sword and shouting\\r\\nout something at the top of his voice as though he would address the\\r\\nbrigade.Lord Cardigan looked angrily at the aide-de-camp; and Captain Norreys,\\r\\nwho was close to him, thinking he was trying to force the pace of the\\r\\nbrigade, shouted out, ‘No, no, Nolan, that won’t do; we’ve got a long\\r\\nway to go yet.’The Hussar shouted still more frantically and waved his sword, when a\\r\\nshell, the first fired at the Light Brigade, burst just above him and a\\r\\nfragment struck him full in the chest. His features turned livid; but he\\r\\nstill galloped on, his sword-arm held high in the air. He gave one cry,\\r\\na shrill, unearthly scream, then his horse carried him on through the\\r\\ninterval of the 13th Light Dragoons, and he fell to the ground a corpse,\\r\\nthe first to pay the penalty of the fatal blunder for which he was\\r\\npartly responsible, and which was sending four hundred of England’s most\\r\\ngallant sons to their death.The first discharge was followed by others, and in{238} a few seconds a\\r\\nhundred guns and thousands of rifles thundered and rattled. The\\r\\nFedioukine Heights on their left and the Causeway Heights on their right\\r\\nwere held by infantry and field-artillery in great numbers, and these\\r\\nopened a tremendous fire on the devoted horsemen charging down the\\r\\nvalley. Facing them, but at a distance of a mile and a quarter, were\\r\\ntwelve Cossack nine-pounders; and behind these, smarting under their\\r\\nlate defeat and waiting for an opportunity to avenge themselves, could\\r\\nit be done with safety, were the dense columns of cavalry which the\\r\\nheavy Dragoons had rolled up the Causeway Heights little more than\\r\\nhalf-an-hour before.A regiment charging an army! Six hundred light horsemen against\\r\\ntwenty-four thousand of all arms! As they got farther up the valley the\\r\\nfire under which they came was terrific. Shells, round-shot, grape,\\r\\nrockets, tore and ploughed through the ranks, while bullets simply\\r\\nrained. Down the whole length of the line men and horses began to fall,\\r\\nand the cry ran constantly along the ranks, ‘Close up! Close up!’The calmness of the officers seemed terrible. Amidst all the slaughter,\\r\\nCaptains Norreys and Wintle kept a sharp eye on their squadrons, and\\r\\nevery now and then they cried out, ‘Mind your dressing, Private Jones!\\r\\nDo keep back, Wilson! Steady there!’ as a round-shot with a hideous,\\r\\nmoist plunge struck a corporal in the chest and literally cut him in\\r\\ntwo. ‘Steady there, steady! Close up! Close up!’ as a man and horse went\\r\\ndown on the left. Gaps were constantly occurring, and the line was\\r\\ndiminishing as the riders closed in. The riderless horses, their eyes\\r\\nwild with terror, their breasts flecked with foam,{239} galloped along with\\r\\nthe line, trying to force their way to their places in the ranks or\\r\\ncrowding round the officers in front.On, on, ever on they went, Jack keeping his eyes on the crimson overalls\\r\\nand scarlet pelisse, blazing with gold, of Lord Cardigan, who, with his\\r\\nadmirable seat in the saddle and his sword carried at the slope, without\\r\\nturning to right or left, led that line of horsemen straight for the\\r\\nmouths of the guns. Presently a great white cloud of smoke appeared in\\r\\nfront, and from the twelve guns facing them another torrent of shot and\\r\\nshell was poured upon them. Assailed on front and flanks, the fury of\\r\\nthe hail of death was indescribable. The excitement of the men reached\\r\\nfever-heat.Captain Norreys increased the pace and was soon alongside Lord Cardigan,\\r\\nwho put out his sword across the Lancer’s breast.A second round from the battery in front came crashing through the\\r\\nalready torn and mangled ranks; then Lord Cardigan waved his sword and\\r\\nincreased his pace.‘Charge!’ cried Captain Norreys; and Jack jerked out a note or two as\\r\\nthey literally raced along.[5]{240}‘Who is there here would ask another man from England?’ quoted Brandon,\\r\\nbringing his lance down to the ‘engage.’Hardly had the words left his lips when a nine-pounder ball took him in\\r\\nthe face, and his brains were scattered on Jack and Pearson, between\\r\\nwhom he was at that moment riding.{241}‘A little farther, you toads,’ he cried, ‘and then we shall be in\\r\\namongst ’em! Remember the motto of our regiment, “Death or Glory!”’Captain Wintle, Cornet Leland, Sir William Lennox, Sergeant Linham,\\r\\nBrittain, Pearson, and Jack were all together, just to the right rear of\\r\\nLord Cardigan, when the guns in front, not eighty yards away, were all\\r\\nfired simultaneously. The flash from the muzzles seemed almost to burn\\r\\nand blind the devoted riders advancing upon them, a shower of grape\\r\\nswept through them, and almost the whole of the front rank vanished.\\r\\nJack just had time to notice that he and Linham were the only two left\\r\\nof all who had been together a moment before; then they were in the\\r\\nsmoke of the guns, past the gleaming brass muzzles, and in amongst the\\r\\nleather-helmeted artillerymen, cutting and thrusting with the anger of\\r\\nmen who have seen their best comrades blown to pieces.Jack found himself opposed to an immense, beetle-browed fellow, who\\r\\naimed a blow at him with a rammer. Jack drew his pistol and immediately\\r\\nshot him through the head. Another artilleryman made a cut at him with\\r\\nhis sword, but Jack clove his head and made a point at another fellow,\\r\\nwho crept under the wheels of his gun to escape. Vain hope, a Lancer\\r\\nbehind Jack saw him, and in another moment had pinned him to the ground\\r\\nwith his lance.For a couple of minutes, Lancers and Dragoons, the remnant of the\\r\\nleading regiments not more than fifty men in all, raged among the\\r\\nbattery, and very few{242} Russians lived to relate their experiences. The\\r\\nbattery silenced, Jack rode on with his comrades, who then found\\r\\nthemselves faced by a dense mass of Russian cavalry.Captain Norreys immediately held up his sword. ‘Rally on me, 17th,’ he\\r\\ncried; and about twenty men formed behind him.Jack, sword in hand, placed himself with the rest, when the gallant\\r\\ncaptain cried, ‘Now, men, keep together—charge!’ and away they went at\\r\\nthe Russian Dragoons, who sat perfectly still awaiting the shock.Captain Norreys rode straight for the officer in command, and with his\\r\\nsword pierced him through and through. The Russian threw up his arms and\\r\\nfell from the off-side of his horse; and the Lancer, being unable to\\r\\nwithdraw his blade, which was fastened to his wrist by the sword-knot,\\r\\nwas held a prisoner.As Jack flew past he saw his officer receive a cut on the side of the\\r\\nhead which brought him from the saddle. There was no time to stop,\\r\\nhowever, and he dashed on with the handful of Lancers, who crashed into\\r\\nthe Russians, unhorsing and killing a good many, when the rest instantly\\r\\nturned and fled. The Lancers pursued them for some distance till they\\r\\nfound themselves being charged in turn by a horde of Cossacks, who were\\r\\ntaking them in flank, when they drew off towards a small party of the\\r\\n13th.Jack then saw Lord Cardigan some distance ahead, sitting quite calmly on\\r\\nhis horse, with his sword at the slope, while several Cossacks circled\\r\\nround him, poking at him with their lances. A large troop of Cossacks\\r\\nwere just in front of Lord Cardigan, and it{243} seemed as if his enemies\\r\\nwere more intent on capturing than killing him.‘Come on, boys! the chief’s in danger,’ cried Jack; and he dashed\\r\\nforward just as a Cossack got his lance entangled in Lord Cardigan’s\\r\\npelisse.Seeing the handful of Lancers advancing towards them, the Cossacks\\r\\nwheeled and fled, and Lord Cardigan, turning his horse’s head, trotted\\r\\noff back towards the Russian guns, which he passed through and then went\\r\\non down the valley, taking no further part in the fight.Jack heard a shout behind them, and, turning, saw Sergeant Barrymore\\r\\nwith a few men of his own regiment.There was no one above the rank of corporal among the dozen or so men he\\r\\nwas with, and these yielded Jack ready obedience. They followed him and\\r\\nformed up with those of their comrades under Sergeant Barrymore.Some Russian Hussars were passing close to them; and Jack, whose eyes\\r\\nwere very keen, cried, ‘By heaven, they’ve got some of our officers\\r\\nprisoners;’ and before any one could stop him, at headlong pace he\\r\\ncharged down upon the Hussars.He cut down one man who, he saw, was leading along Captain Norreys, who\\r\\nwas bleeding freely from one or two wounds in the head. Bidding the\\r\\ncaptain take hold of his stirrup, Jack then laid about him furiously\\r\\nwith his sword; but he would have been quickly cut to pieces had not\\r\\nSergeant Barrymore{244} come charging down with the rest of the men and put\\r\\nthe Hussars to flight.Besides Captain Norreys, there was an officer of the 11th Hussars\\r\\nprisoner, and both these were rescued. Jack caught a riderless horse,\\r\\nbound up his officer’s head, and, putting a sword in his hand, mounted\\r\\nhim and directed him down the valley.‘Your gallantry will not go unrewarded, Blair,’ said the wounded captain\\r\\nas he started on his homeward ride.Meanwhile the other regiments of the Light Brigade had charged in\\r\\namongst the guns and had prevented the Russians from carrying them off,\\r\\nfor, after the first line of English cavalry passed through, more\\r\\nRussian artillerymen came flocking down and endeavoured to withdraw the\\r\\nguns. Their fire having been silenced by the first line, the 11th\\r\\nHussars passed through the guns with but little damage, and Jack, with\\r\\nhis handful of Lancers, saw them draw up in beautiful order, facing the\\r\\nRussian rear and preparing to charge down upon a large body of Russian\\r\\nHussars and Lancers who faced them.‘We must not be out of this,’ cried Jack, turning round to where\\r\\nBarrymore had been a few minutes before; but the sergeant had\\r\\ndisappeared. ‘17th, follow me!’ cried Jack, waving his sword, and the\\r\\ntroopers trotted off.They formed up on the left of the Hussars just as the colonel gave the\\r\\nword to charge, and away they went at the foe. These did not stand to\\r\\nreceive the shock, but turned and fled, Lancers and Hussars pursuing\\r\\nthem and sabring a good many.Maddened by the terrible charge they had made down that long valley, on\\r\\nwhich they had left the{245} greater part of their comrades, the English\\r\\nwent on till they had driven the Russians right back to the aqueduct\\r\\nagainst the Tractir Bridge. Then, overwhelming masses advancing on both\\r\\nflanks, they gave up the pursuit and halted. Officers shouted commands,\\r\\nand the trumpets sounded threes about, when the 11th wheeled and\\r\\nretired.Jack and his comrades had become separated from the Hussars in the\\r\\ncharge and pursuit, and had gone on farther than any of the rest, having\\r\\nno officer to restrain them. Jack suddenly noticed that they were\\r\\nisolated, and that the other regiments had retreated.‘What are we going to do now, youngster?’ asked a voice behind him, and\\r\\nturning he saw Veigh, the butcher, still smoking his black clay-pipe.The handful of Lancers had not gone far, however, when a whole cloud of\\r\\nCossacks came charging down upon them.‘Keep together!’ cried Jack, spurring out to the front; ‘knee to knee,\\r\\nwe must cut our way through!’This they endeavoured to do; but the enemy surrounding the little group\\r\\nwas too strong, and, circling round, cut and hacked as though determined\\r\\nthat not a solitary man should escape. They were indeed in a tight\\r\\ncorner, and Jack was thinking that not one of them would get away when\\r\\nhe heard a shout from the flank, and on the slope above the Russians saw\\r\\nthe well-known uniform of the 8th Hussars.‘Hurrah! the busby-bags are coming,’ he cried; and in another minute the\\r\\n8th were cutting their way through to their comrades.{246}‘Praise the saints, you’re safe, Jack!’ he said. ‘Come on, this way;\\r\\n17th and 8th for ever! Hurrah for the ould 25th!’They dashed through the Russians and returned to the guns, where they\\r\\nwere joined by a few men of the 4th Light Dragoons, and as fast as their\\r\\ntired horses would go they began to retreat down the valley, which,\\r\\nalas! was now strewn with dead and dying men and horses. Some on foot,\\r\\nsome mounted, singly and in groups, the remnants of the brigade were\\r\\nstaggering back. The Russians on the Causeway Heights had opened again\\r\\nwith rifle and artillery, and were directing their fire on every little\\r\\ngroup.Jack and his comrades did not number more than forty in all, till\\r\\npresently, down the valley, they came upon a little group of Englishmen\\r\\nengaged with a score of Cossacks. Jack recognised his own uniform, and\\r\\nto his joy saw Sergeant Linham and Will, the latter being dismounted.Linham was engaged in a single combat with a Cossack officer, who made a\\r\\ncut which Linham parried. He prepared to return it when the Cossack\\r\\nofficer threw up his hand, then handed the hilt of his sword to Linham.‘Ha, hum, you toad!’ cried the sergeant; ‘form guard there, you heathen.\\r\\nDon’t give up till you’re hurt.’The Russian understood nothing, and as Jack came up with his comrades he\\r\\nnoticed the man was the very same whom they had last seen wounded in the\\r\\ncottage. He seemed to recognise Jack too.{247}Linham cried out angrily, ‘It’s opposed to all the rules of warfare to\\r\\nsurrender in the middle of a fair fight; form your guard.’‘Here, Will,’ cried Jack, seizing the pony of a Cossack who had just\\r\\nbeen cut down; and he helped his chum into the saddle.They now saw that before them several squadrons of Russian Lancers had\\r\\nadvanced into the valley from the slopes, and were drawn up barring\\r\\ntheir progress. Behind them was a whole cloud of Cossacks and Hussars.With the group of cavalrymen of different regiments there was only one\\r\\nofficer, and he was so grievously wounded as to be hardly able to sit\\r\\nhis horse, much less command. Several non-commissioned officers there\\r\\nwere, but these seemed quite willing to act under Jack’s guidance.The opportunity of Jack’s life had occurred, and he took it; he felt\\r\\nthat he was born to command, and it came easy to him.‘Front form!’ he cried, facing his little force. ‘17th on the right!\\r\\nKeep well together and save your horses till I give the word. We shall\\r\\nwant every ounce that is in them.’Jack placed himself well in front of his troop; Sergeant Linham directed\\r\\nthe left, a sergeant of Dragoons the right.{248}From the Causeway Heights they were plied with shot as they advanced;\\r\\nbut as the distance between them and their enemies in front was\\r\\ndecreased the fire necessarily lessened.When fifty yards from the foe, Jack placed his bugle to his mouth and\\r\\nsounded the charge. As the last note rang out a round-shot caught the\\r\\nbugle and dashed it from Jack’s grasp, ripping it from the cord by which\\r\\nit was attached to his shoulder, and almost tearing him from the saddle.\\r\\nSo dazed was he that he dropped his sword, and, allowing it to dangle\\r\\nfrom his wrist by the sword-knot, caught a rein in each hand. He,\\r\\nhowever, headed his horse directly for the officer who seemed in command\\r\\nof the Lancers in front of him. The Russian, seeing the trumpeter making\\r\\nstraight for him, drew aside, and Jack, passing him, dashed in amongst\\r\\nthe men behind him. He went in between two files, and almost before he\\r\\ncould realise it was through.His momentary dizziness passed, and he clutched his sword just as those\\r\\nbehind him crashed into the Lancers. The combat was short and sharp. The\\r\\nRussians had again received the charge at the halt, and again were\\r\\nscattered.Then in front of them Jack perceived more squadrons drawn up to bar\\r\\ntheir way, and these were wheeling back from their left so as to fall\\r\\nupon the flank of the little body as it passed.They were soon up with the second body of Lancers, and as Jack went by\\r\\nhe noticed the same clenched{249} teeth, the same uncertainty of purpose.\\r\\nThough they were in the correct position for their attack, the Russians\\r\\ndid not press it home, and the handful of Englishmen went by, brushing\\r\\naside the lance-points with their swords and losing only one or two men\\r\\nin both charges. But their horses were by then almost done up, their\\r\\npace was only a shambling trot, in many cases little better than a walk.\\r\\nWith renewed fury the guns on the Causeway Heights opened on them,\\r\\nthough Jack noticed that the guns on the Fedioukine Hills were silent.\\r\\nAfterwards he learnt that this was due to the brilliant and timely\\r\\ncharge of D’Allonville with his Chasseurs d’Afrique.The part of the valley along which the survivors of that terrible charge\\r\\nwere struggling bore dreadful testimony to the havoc which had been\\r\\nwrought. Men in the blue and white of Lancer and Dragoon, in the laced\\r\\npelisse and crimson overalls of the Hussars, lay scattered about in\\r\\nevery conceivable attitude of agony and death. Shattered horses and\\r\\nmangled riders lay around. Some men were seen limping painfully, helped\\r\\nby comrades, some even crawling, over the ground strewn with headdresses\\r\\nand accoutrements. And while the enemy still plied them with shot and\\r\\nshell, Cossacks clung to them, spearing without mercy the stragglers,\\r\\ncutting down those who were too weak to move. Besides which, little\\r\\nbands of the defeated Russian Lancers pursued remnants of the brigade\\r\\ntill the Russian artillery, unwilling that any of the ill-fated\\r\\ncavalrymen should escape, opened with grape and shell on both friend and\\r\\nfoe together.The Russians retreated, and the devoted few held on their way a little\\r\\nfarther. Jack was hoping they{250} would, after all, win back to where,\\r\\nstill some distance ahead, he could see the scarlet coats of the Scots\\r\\nGreys, when Dainty suddenly fell dead-lame.Jack, who was in rear of the others, instantly dismounted and found the\\r\\npoor animal had been struck in the foreleg by a bullet. ‘Faithful\\r\\nfriend, I will get you out of this inferno if I can,’ he muttered; and\\r\\nled Dainty, who limped on three legs, along for some distance. His\\r\\ncomrades had got some way down the valley when two shells, in rapid\\r\\nsuccession, burst over them, and several men and horses, mostly of the\\r\\nHussars, fell killed or wounded.While leading his limping horse Jack suddenly noticed on his right a\\r\\ndismounted man of his own regiment engaged with five Cossacks. He turned\\r\\naside to help him just as a shell exploded close by him, one of the\\r\\nsplinters of which struck poor Dainty, and, penetrating to her heart,\\r\\nkilled her on the spot.Jack was dazed for a moment, but he recovered and ran towards his\\r\\ncomrade. The shell which had killed Dainty had also killed three of the\\r\\nCossacks. Jack, taking another from behind, ran him through, when the\\r\\nlast man, after firing at Jack, galloped off.Jack now saw that the man he had come to rescue was Sergeant Barrymore.\\r\\nHe stood over Captain Norreys, who was lying with his leg under a dead\\r\\nhorse.‘I found the captain lying pinned to the ground by his charger,’ said\\r\\nBarrymore, ‘and stayed to help him.’In truth, Captain Norreys was a terrible sight, his{251} face being simply\\r\\ncovered with blood, while his right arm was shattered, smashed by a\\r\\nbullet.Remembering the brandy he had in his water-bottle, Jack gave the captain\\r\\na good drink; then he and Barrymore took a sip. They then managed to get\\r\\nthe dead horse off their officer, when Barrymore took him gently under\\r\\nthe arms, Jack supporting his legs, and they began to carry him along\\r\\nbetween them.By that time they were almost the last of the Light Brigade in the\\r\\nvalley. The Russians directed a heavy fire at them; but although balls\\r\\nhummed and sang round them they won on fifty yards or so unhurt, till\\r\\nseveral more Cossacks, as though grudging that one should escape, came\\r\\nspurring down towards them.The gallant pair had to lay down the wounded captain, and Jack picked up\\r\\nthe carbine and pouch-belt of a Dragoon who lay dead at his feet.‘Then we’ll all die together,’ said Barrymore grimly; and Jack, raising\\r\\nhis carbine, brought down a Cossack. He loaded quickly and fired again\\r\\nwith equal success; then he and Barrymore stood, sword in hand, and for\\r\\na few moments defended Captain Norreys from the Cossacks who circled\\r\\nround, making savage thrusts with their lances.The sergeant managed to give one of them a tremendous gash across the\\r\\nhand with his sabre, on which he fell back, and the others, seeing the\\r\\nresolute attitude of the two Lancers, trotted off.Again Jack and Barrymore took up the wounded officer, this time making a\\r\\nchair of their hands. On{252} and on they staggered, until from sheer\\r\\nexhaustion Jack felt he could go no farther. He began to stumble, and at\\r\\nlast Barrymore was compelled to stop. They were then almost at the end\\r\\nof the valley. They laid down their wounded officer again, but still\\r\\ndetermined to remain with him and die rather than leave him, though he\\r\\nwas then unconscious.They had stood thus for nearly a minute when they heard a cheer behind\\r\\nthem, and a troop of the Scots Greys came up at a trot.‘Come on, comrades,’ cried a hearty voice, and two Dragoons, having a\\r\\nstretcher with them, picked up the wounded Lancer and helped the\\r\\nfaithful pair to carry him down the valley and out of the zone of fire.{253}Many officers came crowding round shaking hands with him and Barrymore,\\r\\ncongratulating them on their escape, and lauding their gallantry in\\r\\nstanding by and rescuing their officer in face of the terrible odds they\\r\\nhad to contend with.A doctor and two assistants came up and took the insensible Captain\\r\\nNorreys in hand, while many questions were poured on Jack and the\\r\\nsergeant.They had answered a few questions; and just then a French General came\\r\\nup, and, pointing to Captain Norreys, said, ‘Your officer, comrades?’‘And you, sous officiers,’ he said, ‘I saw you bring him from under\\r\\nfire. Ah, mes braves, if you were French I would make you officers on\\r\\nthe spot.’ He was the same officer who on seeing the charge exclaimed,\\r\\n‘It is splendid, but it is not war!’A little revived, Jack and Barrymore walked on to the crest of the hill\\r\\non which the remnants of the Light Brigade were forming up. The flutter\\r\\nof lance-pennons showed where Jack’s regiment was, and the{254} two\\r\\nbattle-weary soldiers walked towards them. Jack counted the survivors,\\r\\nofficers and men, under thirty! The 13th Light Dragoons were barely a\\r\\ndozen, and the remains of all five regiments numbered but little over a\\r\\nhundred men. Many of these were bareheaded and blood-stained; all had a\\r\\nstrained, far-away look in their eyes which told of the terrible ordeal\\r\\nthrough which they had passed.[6]Jack gazed along the faces of the men of his own regiment; but none of\\r\\nhis particular friends were there. Captain Norreys, Cornet Leland,\\r\\nLinham, Brandon, Pearson, Williams, Hodson—all, all gone.Jack turned his eyes down the hill. One or two weary, wounded stragglers\\r\\nwere seen coming up—a man of the 11th Hussars, his head bound up,\\r\\nleaning round the neck of a Light Dragoon; two men of the 8th,\\r\\nhalf-carrying a trumpeter between them.{255} Jack strained his eyes; it was\\r\\nnot Larry, neither did he see his Irish friend with his regiment.He felt his hand grasped, and, turning, saw Will, his arm bound round\\r\\nwith a blood-stained bandage. He had just come from having his wound\\r\\ndressed.‘Gone, Jack. All gone,’ half-sobbed Will; and at those words Jack’s\\r\\nfortitude gave way and the tears rolled down his weather-beaten face.\\r\\n‘It can’t be helped Jack,’ said Will. ‘It’s been a horrible blunder; but\\r\\nat least we’ve done our duty. You’re wounded though. Look at your cap.’Jack removed his battered lance-cap, and found it had a bullet-hole\\r\\nthrough it, and that a sabre had cut the square top right down to the\\r\\nplate in front, inflicting a slight wound on his head, of which he was\\r\\nquite unaware. He had a graze from a bullet on his left shoulder, the\\r\\nright leg of his overalls had been ripped open by a lance or sword,\\r\\nexposing the flesh, and there were several rents in his uniform.Presently the roll was called, and thirty-five of the 17th answered to\\r\\ntheir names, every man, when the name of a missing comrade was called,\\r\\ngiving what information he could as to when he had last seen his chum.\\r\\nSeveral men spoke to having seen poor Brandon’s head literally blown to\\r\\npieces. Pearson had been seen returning down the valley unhorsed, and\\r\\nfighting with five Russians. Cornet Leland had been seen for the last\\r\\ntime amongst the cavalry in rear of the guns; but none knew what had\\r\\nhappened to Sergeant Linham, he seemed to have disap{256}peared about the\\r\\ntime when Jack’s horse had been killed.While the roll was being called and the farriers were busy with their\\r\\npistols despatching the wounded horses, Lord Cardigan rode up to the\\r\\nremnants of the brigade. His face wore a sorrowful expression.The charge of the Light Brigade lasted but twenty minutes, and it was\\r\\nbarely noon when the survivors formed up on the hill overlooking the\\r\\nvalley.Firing went on till four o’clock, but nothing else was attempted by the\\r\\nAllies. The cavalry retired some distance from the site of their old\\r\\ncamp, and the field remained in possession of the enemy.In the evening, as the survivors struggled to light fires to cook their\\r\\nrations, an ominous silence reigned.They had just taken part in the most brilliant cavalry charge in modern\\r\\nwarfare. Every survivor, so long as he should live, would be looked upon\\r\\nas a hero; but there was no elation. Every one was thinking of friends\\r\\nand comrades, sometimes brothers, lying cold and stiff out in that\\r\\nValley of Death. It would be a terrible day for those left behind in\\r\\nEngland!Presently the men sought their tents; but few of them could sleep. Of\\r\\nthose who had occupied Jack’s tent he was the only one left. Linham,\\r\\nBrandon, Pearson, Williams—all were gone. He asked Will to share his\\r\\ntent with him, and they both turned in. Presently Jack, who had been\\r\\ntrying to get to sleep, jumped up.‘My mind keeps running on our comrades. I ca{257}n’t get it out of my head\\r\\nthat they may be out there on the field, perhaps dying for the want of a\\r\\ndrink of water.’The two donned their forage-caps, and each taking a pistol and their\\r\\nwater-bottles, in which they had some spirits-and-water, they started.They made their way to the north valley, easily passing the picket. They\\r\\nreached the spot from whence the Light Brigade had started, and kept\\r\\nalong till presently they came to the place where Nolan had been killed.\\r\\nHis dead body still lay where it had fallen.Some distance farther along they came to several dead horses; then men,\\r\\nall in the blue and white of their own regiment or the 13th Light\\r\\nDragoons, either stretched out as though asleep, or lying in curiously\\r\\nhuddled-up positions. Some of their comrades they recognised; in others,\\r\\nthe nature of their wounds was such as to render this impossible. All\\r\\nwere dead, however.As they proceeded farther the pale moonbeams showed some Hussars. Among\\r\\nthem they came to a poor fellow of the 11th with one leg crushed, who\\r\\nfrom time to time moaned in agony. This man they were able to make more\\r\\ncomfortable, and gave him a drink, for which he blessed them.They were moving farther along when they saw at a little distance from\\r\\nthem another figure, crouching low as though to avoid detection. In an\\r\\ninstant Will cocked his pistol.{258}He was about to pull the trigger when Jack seized his arm. ‘Don’t fire,’\\r\\nhe said, ‘the Russians are in possession of the field and must be close\\r\\nto us. We shall bring them down on us. We are two to one; pick up one of\\r\\nthese swords lying about and let us tackle him.’They did so, and advanced towards the man, who as quickly retreated. As\\r\\nhe did so Jack saw that the man was a soldier, and he seemed to be\\r\\nwearing a scarlet tunic.The man in front, halted and turned round, when Jack and Will, getting\\r\\nnearer, to their surprise saw he was a British Dragoon.‘I might as well ask you that,’ replied the Dragoon, recognising the\\r\\nuniform of the 17th; ‘but I’m Denis O’Callaghan of the Inniskillings,\\r\\nand I’m looking for my cousin Larry. He’s in the 8th Hussars, and I’m\\r\\ntold he’s not with his regiment, so I could not rest till I tried to\\r\\nfind the poor bhoy’s body.’Together, then, the three searched, and presently they came across\\r\\nseveral Hussars in blue and yellow. One was lying on his face, and in an\\r\\ninstant Jack saw the gold chevrons of a sergeant glittering faintly in\\r\\nthe moonlight. There was a trumpet{259} on his back too, and Jack’s heart\\r\\ngrew heavy as he saw it.Gently he stepped up to the body and turned it over. Larry’s well-known\\r\\nfeatures were exposed. Jack dropped on his knees and raised his friend’s\\r\\nhead; his face was white as marble. He felt under the laced jacket; all\\r\\nwas cold and still and silent, the faithful heart had ceased to beat.\\r\\nTears, of which Jack was not ashamed, dropped on poor Larry’s face.‘True comrade, faithful heart,’ Jack murmured, ‘God has willed that you\\r\\nshall never be trumpet-major of the 8th; but you have gone to join that\\r\\nnobler army in the ranks of which we must all sooner or later answer to\\r\\nour names.’‘Ochone, ochone!’ wailed the big Dragoon; ‘shure this will be a sad day\\r\\nfor ould Con O’Callaghan. Larry was the apple of his eye, his favourite\\r\\nson, who followed in the ould man’s footsteps. Wirra, wirra, Larry\\r\\ndarlint, spake to me!’He had been killed by the splinter of a shell, and death must have been\\r\\ninstantaneous, for the poor lad’s face still wore a kind of triumphant\\r\\nsmile. They straightened his limbs, sheathed the sword still attached by\\r\\nthe sword-knot to his wrist, and placed his trumpet and bugle on his\\r\\nbreast. The Dragoon knelt beside his dead cousin in prayer for a minute,\\r\\nand Jack and Will stood bareheaded.Suddenly a faint scream broke on the night air, and Jack, looking behind\\r\\nhim, saw a dark figure bending over a dead or wounded man. As he gazed\\r\\nhe saw a gleam of steel, and in an instant, being{260} suspicious, darted\\r\\ntowards the spot. As he did so a tall, thin figure in a long, dark sort\\r\\nof gown darted away. Jack followed him, Will coming on behind.The man, who carried a little sack, ran swiftly, and the two Lancers\\r\\nchased him for some distance down towards the Russian lines before they\\r\\novertook him. They then saw he was a hook-nosed villain with a long\\r\\nblack beard, and Jack immediately grappled him.The fellow drew a knife and tried to stab Jack; but the latter seized\\r\\nhis wrist and held it. Will coming up, they got the man on the ground,\\r\\nand, overpowering him, proceeded to bind him with the bridle of a dead\\r\\nhorse. This done, they examined the bag he was carrying, and saw it was\\r\\nfilled with gold epaulets, watches, rings, money, medals, even chevrons\\r\\nand sword-knots.‘If nothing worse,’ said Will. ‘Look at this!’ and he held up the knife\\r\\nwhich he had wrested from him. There was a dark, sticky fluid on the\\r\\nblade.Close behind them a number of men, some carrying lanterns, had crept up,\\r\\nand several with rifles in their hands were advancing rapidly towards\\r\\nthe two Lancers.They did as Jack suggested, and lay still for a second. But rapid\\r\\nfootsteps approaching, they felt themselves seized, and looking up saw\\r\\nthe flat faces and dark-gray coats of several Russians.For a few moments Jack half-expected to be immediately despatched, for\\r\\nominous tales about the treatment of wounded and prisoners by the\\r\\nRussians had found their way to the camp of the Allies. Instead, he and\\r\\nWill were raised to their feet, and on the group with the lanterns\\r\\napproaching Jack saw, to his surprise, several officers of high rank.One, a handsome man with a white moustache, on whose breast several\\r\\norders glittered, spoke sharply to his companions, some of whom spoke in\\r\\nreply. Then the scoundrel whom the Lancers had bound was discovered, on\\r\\nwhich the Russian officers spoke rapidly together.Then a couple of soldiers came and felt over Jack’s and Will’s uniforms,\\r\\nas though to find out whether they had any ill-gotten gains concealed\\r\\nabout their persons.The action was so significant that Jack cried out, ‘Good Heavens, they\\r\\ncan’t think we’ve anything to do with that vile wretch! Can’t they see\\r\\nby our uniforms we’re English soldiers?’‘If you are,’ said a voice in excellent English, ‘why are you prowling\\r\\nabout on the battlefield? Do you not know you are liable to be shot as\\r\\nspies?{262}’Jack turned in surprise and saw he was addressed by an officer in a\\r\\nhandsome uniform of green and silver.The white-moustached officer now spoke, and the officer in green said,\\r\\n‘General Liprandi wants to know at once who you are, and what you are\\r\\ndoing here?’Jack related what had happened; and on the officer translating to the\\r\\nGeneral, he gave a curt command; when two of the soldiers, despite the\\r\\nscreams of the wretch, knelt the fellow up, levelled their muskets at\\r\\nhim, and shot him dead.That being finished, the officer, translating for General Liprandi,\\r\\nsaid, ‘Do you belong to one of the regiments which charged down the\\r\\nvalley this morning?’General Liprandi took a lantern and held it up to their faces; then\\r\\nnoticing the skull and cross-bones on the buttons of their jackets,\\r\\nasked, through his interpreter, how they came to have such a badge. On\\r\\nJack replying, the General, with a small penknife, cut two of the\\r\\nbuttons from his jacket and put them in his pocket. He then asked, ‘Were\\r\\nnot all your{263} men and officers drunk when they charged this morning?’This the General did not seem inclined to believe, when, an idea\\r\\nstriking Jack, he said, ‘If you like to look in the haversacks of any of\\r\\nmy dead countrymen you will doubtless find their day’s rations\\r\\nuntouched!’Various other questions as to the number of troops the English had, what\\r\\nthey thought of the action of the day, and so on, were put to Jack and\\r\\nWill, none of which they would answer. They were then asked if they\\r\\ncould prove they had only ventured on the field of battle in search of\\r\\nwounded comrades, and Jack replied that if the Russians would return a\\r\\nlittle way along the valley with him he would show them the body of a\\r\\ncomrade whom they had decently laid out.To Jack’s surprise he was told to lead the way, the Russians following\\r\\nhim. When they came to the place where poor Larry lay, the trumpeters\\r\\nwere alarmed to see the Dragoon still kneeling, as though in prayer,\\r\\nbeside the body of his cousin.Jack expected every instant he too would be made a prisoner; but on a\\r\\nsharp word from General Liprandi, the officers removed their headdresses\\r\\nand stood still till the poor pious Irishman, looking up, saw to his\\r\\nintense astonishment the group of Russians, with Jack and Will prisoners\\r\\namong them. He jumped to his feet, when the English-speaking officer\\r\\nsaid, ‘Do not be afraid; we shall not hurt you. And you two,’ turning to\\r\\nJack and Will, ‘are free. The General{264} says you may return to your camp\\r\\nand do not trouble any more about your wounded. It is for this very\\r\\nreason these men you see about are on the field. He bids me tell you\\r\\nthat the Russians are Christians as well as the English, and that what\\r\\nthe English doctors did for the Russian wounded after the battle of the\\r\\nAlma our doctors will do for your wounded after our victory of\\r\\nBalaclava.’ The words ‘victory of Balaclava’ rankled in Jack’s mind.\\r\\nTrue, the Russians had possession of the field, and had even captured a\\r\\nfew English guns; but not once had they stood before the English, who\\r\\nhad proved their superiority in the field and driven the Russians before\\r\\nthem.However, that was no moment for arguing, and, thankful to regain his\\r\\nliberty, he asked permission to take the dead body of Larry with them.\\r\\nThis being granted, they departed towards their own lines.Confident that any of their wounded comrades would be well treated did\\r\\nthey fall into the hands of General Liprandi, Denis O’Callaghan returned\\r\\nwith Jack and Will, and they reached their lines just as word had been\\r\\ngiven to move the camp half a mile farther back.They then wrapped poor Larry in the cloak of a dead Lancer, and Denis\\r\\nsat beside the body till daylight, while Jack, at last worn out with the\\r\\nexertions of the past day and night, lay down and slept almost as\\r\\nsoundly as his dead friend.Williams, who had been wounded in the charge, had managed to crawl back\\r\\nto the English lines during the night, and was then in hospital. The\\r\\nnext day the remnants of the light cavalry brigade were moved still\\r\\nfarther up the valley.During the day, the Russians, elated with a rose-{265}coloured account of\\r\\nthe battle of Balaclava, made a determined attack upon the Second\\r\\nDivision; but the English outlying pickets met them bravely and held\\r\\nthem in check till reinforcements came up, when the able commander of\\r\\nthe division so handled his men that he drew the enemy on till he had\\r\\ngot him within his grasp, and then completely crushed him with his\\r\\nartillery, killing and wounding about five hundred.Poor Larry was laid to rest with military honours. Jack cut the gold\\r\\nchevrons from his jacket to keep in remembrance of him, and Denis\\r\\nO’Callaghan, with the permission of Larry’s colonel, had his bugle,\\r\\nwhich he intended to send to Larry’s father. The trumpeters of his own\\r\\nand Jack’s regiment, only five in all, attended and sounded the ‘last\\r\\npost’ over the grave in which he was laid, his only covering being the\\r\\nold Lancer cloak in which Jack had wrapped him. During the ceremony,\\r\\nJerry, the regimental dog of the 8th Hussars, sat looking as if he\\r\\nunderstood it all, giving an occasional whine, and following the men of\\r\\nthe 8th when they turned away from the grave.Two days later the camp was again shifted to a pretty spot up among the\\r\\nhills on the road from Balaclava, close to the rear of the French centre\\r\\non the Sapoune Ridge.The depression in the Light Brigade caused by their terrible losses\\r\\nbegan to wear off, and the men were pretty busy doing orderly and escort\\r\\nduty.Jack’s share in the great fight was brought under notice of Captain\\r\\nMorgan, then in command, Captain Wintle having been killed and Captain\\r\\nNorreys in hospital. He was the only soldier who had taken part in both\\r\\ncharges, and earned more celebrity than his modesty appreciated.{266}Sergeant Barrymore, who was promoted to sergeant-major after the charge,\\r\\nsaid on several occasions, ‘Captain Norreys took the old regiment into\\r\\naction; but if any one can be said to have brought out what remained of\\r\\nit, that man was Jack Blair. He is, so far as “Ours” is concerned, the\\r\\nhero of Balaclava.’ The men fully agreeing, Jack got the nickname of\\r\\n‘Blair of Balaclava.’Being then old enough, acting on the advice of Captain Norreys, who in\\r\\nspite of his terrible hurts was in a fair way of recovery, Jack\\r\\ntransferred to the ranks, resigning his place as trumpeter. In fact\\r\\nthere was small need for a trumpeter at all with the handful of men who\\r\\nwere left, and Will was quite able to do all the duty required. Jack on\\r\\ntransfer received promotion, and found himself in orders as sergeant,\\r\\nprobably the youngest sergeant in the Crimea.During the next few days the pickets and vedettes, keeping an ever\\r\\nwatchful eye on the enemy, noticed that enormous reinforcements reached\\r\\nthe Russians, and it was evident that the Czar, probably enraged at the\\r\\nidea of a mere handful of hardy soldiers invading his territories and\\r\\nsitting down before his fortress of Sebastopol, had determined to use\\r\\nall the resources of his mighty empire to sweep the arrogant invaders\\r\\ninto the sea.Thousands upon thousands of men, horse, foot, and artillery, were poured\\r\\ninto Sebastopol, whole divisions at a time, and to the badly fed,\\r\\nragged, and overworked heroes in the allied camps it became evident that\\r\\nsoon, very soon, they would have to wage grim battle against their enemy\\r\\nfor their very existence.{267}The brigade descended from the heights, crossed the swampy ground, and\\r\\ngot across the Tchernaya or Black River by the ford. Thence they went on\\r\\nfor some distance in the direction of Mackenzie’s Farm; and as Jack\\r\\nrecognised the country he and his comrades, then so full of high spirits\\r\\nafter the victory of the Alma, had crossed over on the flank march, his\\r\\nheart grew heavy within him. Where were those comrades now? Alas! they\\r\\nwere gone to await that final muster at which all must answer to their\\r\\nnames and give an account of their lives.Many Cossack vedettes were seen, but these promptly retired from ridge\\r\\nto ridge before the British cavalry, who, making a detour to their left,\\r\\nskirted the Inkermann ruins, reforded the Tchernaya, and regained their\\r\\ncamp, having discovered nothing of any importance.It was on the Friday following that a whole division of horse, foot, and\\r\\nartillery were seen to be entering Sebastopol, and every one knew a\\r\\ngreat battle was near at hand.All day Saturday it poured with rain, and in the evening Jack and Will,\\r\\nafter vainly striving to light{268} a fire with damp roots, gave it up, and\\r\\nwrapping themselves in their cloaks retired inside their tent.‘True; but after all the cavalry were the only sufferers there. If\\r\\nanything happened to the whole army we should be in a hole if you like,\\r\\nand with the reinforcements the Russians have been receiving lately they\\r\\nmust outnumber us and the French and Turks by at least two to one.’‘And tied up as we are, having to find all the pickets and guards, to\\r\\nman the trenches, keep open our road to Balaclava and guard that, why,\\r\\nif the Russians delivered an attack in force we couldn’t put ten\\r\\nthousand men in the field to face them to save our lives.’Both lapsed into silence, then Jack started up. ‘Will, I can’t rest,’ he\\r\\nsaid, ‘I feel something is going to happen. I’m going to creep by our\\r\\nLight Division pickets and try if I can see or hear anything. I noticed\\r\\nout by the Inkermann Heights dozens of places, ruins and caves, where\\r\\nany one could lie safely hidden from sight, but could yet observe all\\r\\nthat was going on round them. Are you game to accompany me?’‘You seem determined to run into unnecessary danger,’ said Will; ‘but if\\r\\nyou’re bent on going I’m with you.{269}’The rain by then had left off, and leaving their cloaks behind, so as to\\r\\nbe able to move more freely, Jack and Will left their lines.They carried only pistols with them, relying upon their agility to keep\\r\\nout of the way of any prowling Russian sentries or patrols. They made\\r\\ntheir way past the camp of the Light Division, and creeping down a\\r\\nravine made towards the river. Emerging safely from the ravine, they\\r\\nsaw, some couple of miles in front of them, the lighthouse, which they\\r\\nknew stood at the head of the roadstead of Sebastopol.They then had the Karabel Faubourg of Sebastopol on their left; and\\r\\nthough it was too misty to see the lights of the town they heard the\\r\\nchurch bells ringing. They ascended a slight hill, noticing that several\\r\\ncaves opened from it into the side of the hill. They entered one or two\\r\\nof these, disturbing flocks of sea-gulls as they did so.It began again to drizzle with rain, and the two lads entered one of the\\r\\ncaves to get out of the wet. They remained there some time, Jack being\\r\\nbusy thinking, when he suddenly exclaimed, ‘Will, it must be getting on\\r\\ntowards morning. Doesn’t it strike you as strange that the church bells\\r\\nin Sebastopol should be kicking up such a row at this time of night?’‘It is a bit funny; but perhaps, as to-morrow’s Sunday, it’s one of\\r\\ntheir saints’ days, and they’re sort of ringing him in.{270}’But presently they heard twelve o’clock chiming from the various\\r\\nchurches, and still the bells kept ringing.‘Well,’ said Jack, ‘I’m going to try and get a bit nearer to the town to\\r\\nsee what’s up; the Russians are not ringing those bells for nothing.’Accordingly, the two lads left the cave and began to descend the\\r\\nsomewhat steep sides of the hill. By some mischance they did not descend\\r\\nat the same place they had gone up, getting on a much more steep part.They found themselves slipping, and they turned sideways, grabbing at\\r\\nthe tufts of scrub as they went down. But presently these tufts ceased,\\r\\nthe ground was loose and stony, and helter-skelter through the mist Jack\\r\\nand Will descended. They had almost reached the bottom of the hill when\\r\\nJack thought he heard voices. He called out to Will and tried to stop;\\r\\nbut the hill was too steep and he was going too fast.A gruff challenge rang out; then a dozen flat-capped soldiers in long\\r\\ncoats almost to their feet loomed big in the fog, and with a crash Jack\\r\\nand Will dashed into them. Several cries, either of anger or fear, rang\\r\\nout; then bang! bang! went a couple of rifles.A heavy hand was laid upon him; but he tore himself free. Another man\\r\\nadvanced towards him, but Jack’s pistol was in his hand, and he shot the\\r\\nfellow in the leg. He was then free; but, turning, he saw Will in the\\r\\ngrasp of two Russians.The man whom Jack had shot had dropped his rifle, and this Jack\\r\\ninstantly picked up. He pointed it at one of Will’s captors and pulled\\r\\nthe trigger.{271} The man fell. A crashing blow with the butt-end on the\\r\\nshoulder of the second Russian made him release his hold.‘Come, Will,’ cried Jack; and before the other astonished Russians could\\r\\ndo anything they dashed away up the hill.They were soon out of sight in the mist; but several shots were fired in\\r\\ntheir direction, the balls chipping up the rocky ground around them. The\\r\\nheavy, crashing footsteps of the Russians could be heard behind them\\r\\ntoo, and it was clear they were not going to be allowed to escape with\\r\\nimpunity.Jack and Will struggled and panted up the hillside, and, being lighter,\\r\\ngot along quicker than their pursuers.The two dashed in; but the pursuing Russians had seen them, and one\\r\\nfellow ran up and fired his rifle into the black opening. The ball\\r\\nwhizzed uncomfortably near Jack’s head.‘Let’s throw ourselves down,’ said Will, and this they did; luckily,\\r\\nindeed, for several other bullets were fired into the cave.The lads could hear the Russians outside talking and stamping about.\\r\\nPresently there was a glare, and a big Russian, stooping, entered the\\r\\ncave, carrying a lighted lantern. He was followed by several others, all\\r\\nhaving rifles with fixed bayonets in their hands.‘If those pasty-faced scoundrels get hold of us,’ said Jack, ‘it’s all\\r\\nover with us. Will, we must put out that light. Load your pistol.{272}’On hearing Jack’s voice the Russian stopped, and one man, pointing his\\r\\nmusket, fired. He imagined the lads were standing though, and again\\r\\nfired too high.Two reports rang out; there was a groan and a strong smell of gunpowder.\\r\\nThe lantern had been dashed to the ground and extinguished, and judging\\r\\nby the sounds, the other Russians were beating a hasty retreat.All remained silent for some time, then Jack said, ‘We’ve driven them\\r\\noff for the moment; but I should not be surprised if they waited at the\\r\\nmouth of the cave for us. If they do catch us our fate is sealed. After\\r\\nour usage of them they won’t trouble to take us prisoners.’The lads sat down and waited for what seemed ages, but which was in\\r\\nreality about an hour. Then they crept noiselessly to the mouth of the\\r\\ncave and looked out.There, sitting round a small fire which they had somehow managed to\\r\\nmake, were nine Russian soldiers, one having his hand bound up. Their\\r\\nmuskets were all close handy, and they seemed ready to leap to their\\r\\nfeet at a moment’s notice.Jack and Will crawled back again into the cave, and spite of themselves\\r\\npresently fell asleep. How long Jack slept he had not at the moment the\\r\\nfaintest idea. He awoke Will softly.They got up and blundered slowly along in the pitchy darkness, but they\\r\\ndid not come to the mouth of the cave.‘Funny,’ said Will; ‘seems we’ve come a tremendous distance, and it’s\\r\\nstrange how fresh the air is in here.’On and on they crept till presently a faint, very faint light, or rather\\r\\nless dense blackness, appeared before them. They hastened, and soon\\r\\nfound themselves at a mouth of the cave; but it did not seem the one\\r\\nthey had entered by. Anyway, no Russians were in sight.There, a good distance away on their right, was the glimmer of a fire,\\r\\nand dim forms could be seen round it.Silently the lads stole away, keeping up on the side of the hill. For\\r\\nhalf-an-hour they kept on; then they began to wonder where they were.\\r\\nThe night was so dark and the mist so thick that it was impossible to\\r\\ntell in which direction they ought to go to reach the British camp.‘I’m afraid we have,’ said Jack, ‘and the fact that we can’t see the\\r\\nmoon prevents my being able to take our bearings.’‘This is lucky,’ said Jack, ‘for we know that if{274} we keep the river on\\r\\nour left we must be going towards our camp. If we keep along the ridge\\r\\non our right we shall strike the outposts of the Light Division.’They climbed up the ridge and reached the top, when by a common impulse\\r\\nthey stopped. Borne upward faintly on the misty, wet-laden air, was a\\r\\nrumbling, grinding noise, accompanied by a kind of sullen hum like the\\r\\nbuzzing of millions of bees.They descended the side of the ridge and presently through the mist\\r\\ncould make out the ghostly forms of men marching in files closely\\r\\npacked, passing, passing, apparently without end. Then came the grinding\\r\\nof wheels on the gritty ground, accompanied by the jangling of chains\\r\\nand harness, as gun after gun went by.Jack and Will reascended the ridge, and then far away on their left\\r\\nsimilar sounds of marching thousands and numberless guns could be heard.‘The enemy is marching in overwhelming numbers,’ said Jack. ‘Our camp is\\r\\nasleep. In this fog it will be surprised. Will, come on; on our efforts\\r\\nperhaps depend the lives of hundreds of our countrymen.’‘We must give them warning,’ said Will; and at top speed the intrepid\\r\\nLancers started off. On and on they went, directed by the sounds of the\\r\\nadvancing Russians.{275}These, to some extent, they were presently enabled to leave behind; but\\r\\non the right and left ominous rumblings could still be heard.Blundering, falling, running, Jack and Will tore on, their one idea\\r\\nbeing to put their countrymen on their guard. Sometimes they were so\\r\\nclose to the Russians that they could almost have touched them, but\\r\\nProvidence always protected them. Presently they struck a road, and this\\r\\nthey raced along till, emerging suddenly from the fog, a quick challenge\\r\\nfell upon their ears.‘Stay where you are,’ returned a stern voice, and in an instant several\\r\\nmen belonging to a picket of the 41st Regiment advanced and seized them.The curious humming buzz of the advancing hordes could be distinctly\\r\\nheard by all. The sergeant sent for the officer of the picket, which had\\r\\njust been newly posted. He heard what Jack and Will had to say, and\\r\\nasked them how they came to be outside the British lines. Being\\r\\nanswered, he said calmly, ‘Return at once, sergeant, and tell the\\r\\nofficer in command of the relieved picket what you’ve heard. Then go and\\r\\nalarm the camp.’He then went up to the brow of the hill in front, Jack and Will with\\r\\nhim. Soon, very soon, just as day was breaking, he saw close upon him\\r\\nthe leading columns of two Russian battalions. He fell back and gave his\\r\\nmen the order to deliver their fire.{276}Three crashing volleys rang out, and the advancing columns, taken by\\r\\nsurprise and thus suddenly greeted, fell back.The battle of Inkermann, the most sanguinary struggle that has taken\\r\\nplace since war cursed the earth, had begun.{277}The picket of the 41st were outnumbered a hundred to one; but they\\r\\nrefused to give ground. For half-an-hour they maintained their position,\\r\\nand long before that time had elapsed both Jack and Will, possessing\\r\\nthemselves of the rifles and cartridge-pouches of two men who had\\r\\nfallen, were bearing their part with their comrades of the line.During the half-hour in which the picket stuck to their post, the\\r\\nRussians placed twenty-two heavy guns on the height known as Shell Hill,\\r\\njust in front of them. When these opened fire, and not till then, the\\r\\ngallant picket retired, not falling back, but moving away to their\\r\\nright.A fierce struggle was then taking place between other Russian columns\\r\\nand a company of the 49th. Jack’s party joined these, and presently a\\r\\nBritish field-battery came groping its way through the mist in order to\\r\\nfind a suitable place on which to unlimber and open fire. The ground was\\r\\nmuch encumbered with thick brushwood, and it was some time before they\\r\\ncould unlimber. Even then they paused before opening fire, for the mist\\r\\nwas so thick that they{278} could not see whether Russians or English were\\r\\nbefore them.Presently the 49th were assailed with so tremendous a fire that they\\r\\nfell back with loss, retiring to reform behind the guns. Before these\\r\\nlatter could open fire, with yelps and shouts, dense masses of\\r\\ngray-coated, flat-capped Russians threw themselves upon the gunners, and\\r\\na terrific hand-to-hand combat commenced. The men fired literally in\\r\\neach other’s faces; then muskets were clubbed, and a fierce mêlée\\r\\nensued.‘Fire a round of case,’ yelled the officer in command of the guns; but\\r\\nthe enemy was in amongst the gunners.A young lieutenant of artillery drew his sword, and crying to his men to\\r\\ndo likewise and follow him, charged at the enemy. A shower of bullets\\r\\ngreeted him and those who followed him, amongst whom were Jack and Will.\\r\\nThen the Russians, as though bewildered by the suddenness of this\\r\\nonslaught, halted, and in an instant men with swords, rammers, and\\r\\nsponge-staves were in amongst them, smiting them and hurling them back.\\r\\nOne enormous gunner, having smashed a rammer on a particularly thick\\r\\nRussian skull, stood alone for some time, felling Russian after Russian\\r\\nwith tremendous sledge-hammer blows of his fists. Then the Russians\\r\\nrallied, rolled on in irresistible numbers, drove back the defenders,\\r\\nand three of the guns were in the enemy’s hands.The artillery lieutenant, borne back with the sullenly retreating\\r\\ninfantry, loudly bewailed the loss of his beloved guns, and the men of\\r\\nthe 41st and the 49th, reforming, poured such a galling fire upon the\\r\\nadvancing Russians that they halted and wavered.‘Men,’ cried the officer in command, ‘the enemy{279} pauses; give them one\\r\\nmore volley, then let them have the bayonet.’As was frequently the case during the day, the fog lifted for a few\\r\\nminutes and showed the little band of Englishmen that they were opposed\\r\\nto several whole battalions fully six thousand strong. They also saw\\r\\nthat four slender companies of the 77th Regiment, barely two hundred and\\r\\nfifty strong, coming down the crest, had as it were come unexpectedly\\r\\nupon the huge horde of Russians. Not for one instant did they pause,\\r\\nhowever. They delivered a crashing volley; then, led by several mounted\\r\\nofficers, with a soul-stirring cheer they charged with the bayonet. They\\r\\ndashed in amongst the dense masses of Russian infantry, literally\\r\\nrolling them up. The gray-coated battalions broke and wavered.‘Now is our time, men,’ cried the officer in command of the mixed party\\r\\nwith which were Jack and Will, and bringing their bayonets down to the\\r\\ncharge they sprang forward to complete the work so gallantly begun by\\r\\nthe 77th.The Russians had faced half-about to meet the 77th, and Jack’s party\\r\\ntook them in flank, bayoneting and driving them backward like sheep. The\\r\\ngreat battalions broke and fled for their lives, leaving hundreds of\\r\\ndead behind them. The captured guns, which had been left where they\\r\\nwere, were retaken, and the artillerymen almost wept with joy to find\\r\\ntheir weapons had not been spiked.The defeated battalions were pursued down to the very slopes of Shell\\r\\nHill, and it was only when the Russian artillery posted on the crest\\r\\nbegan to hurl{280} showers of shot and shell amongst the handful of British\\r\\nthat the bugles sounded the rally, and the men retreated to the ground\\r\\nthey had originally occupied. Then those two Russian battalions, the\\r\\nCatherinburg and Tomsk, retreated from the field and took no more part\\r\\nin that day’s fighting.‘Cavalry work is brilliant,’ said Jack; ‘but after all it’s the infantry\\r\\nthat do the real business. That charge was grand, Will.’But the tremendous fire from the guns on Shell Hill was so rending and\\r\\ntearing them that this gallant band had to retire, and but few would\\r\\nhave lived to tell the tale had it not been for the English artillery,\\r\\nwhich silenced some of the Russian guns.The remainder of the 41st Regiment, under General Adams, advancing,\\r\\nJack’s party formed in their rear and marched with them towards the spot\\r\\nknown as the Fore Ridge, which was being assaulted by an overwhelming\\r\\nforce of Russians. Marching along the ridge, the gallant seven hundred\\r\\ndescended the slope, meeting on their way the pickets driven in from the\\r\\nfront.Then through the fog they saw looming enormous columns of Russians,\\r\\nthousands strong. The English fired a volley, and while they were\\r\\nreloading the Russian bugles began to sound and the men to face about\\r\\nand retreat.The voice of the gallant Adams rang out, but only those near him could\\r\\nhear, ‘Another volley, lads; then charge!’Those near him started; the others followed the example, and the line\\r\\ndashed downhill, crashing into the Russian column, which turned and\\r\\nfled. They were the Taroutine and Borodino regiments, the same{281} that the\\r\\nBritish had taught such a terrible lesson to on the day of the Alma.\\r\\nDisheartened by their previous experience, their hearts failed them;\\r\\nleaving hundreds of dead and wounded behind them, they too fled, and\\r\\nwere no more seen that day.It was with difficulty that the pursuit by the victorious English could\\r\\nbe stopped; but at last they were brought back and took up their\\r\\nposition in what was known as the Sandbag Battery, which was simply a\\r\\ndismounted earthwork having a parapet about eight or nine feet high, but\\r\\nno banquette on which the men defending it might stand to fire over\\r\\nthe top. It had afforded a shelter from the wind to the pickets\\r\\nstationed there; but for defensive purposes it was useless. Yet it was\\r\\nfor the possession of this useless work that the fiercest struggles of\\r\\nthe day took place.Hardly were the defeated battalions out of range than ten thousand fresh\\r\\nmen, with ninety-seven more guns, came forward to the attack. So quickly\\r\\ndid they appear through the fog, and so much were all the Russian\\r\\nsoldiers alike, that the English thought it was the same force they had\\r\\ndefeated returning to the attack.These fresh troops, stern-looking, resolute men, came on with great\\r\\ndetermination, and soon a terrific combat began. The guns on the Home\\r\\nRidge behind did good work by pouring in their fire on the Russians, the\\r\\nvivid, searing flashes showing up through the mist.Often the opposing bodies met bayonet to bayonet; then the Russians\\r\\nwould be hurled back and the English would coolly load and pour in a\\r\\nvolley. Again the bayonet, a struggle, heaving first this way,{282} then\\r\\nthat; the repulse of the enemy, another volley, and another attack.But the hundreds who were holding their ground against the thousands\\r\\nwere feeling the stress. A seventh part of their number was down, and\\r\\nthough they had done fourfold the damage they had suffered, yet as fast\\r\\nas they shot or bayoneted a foe, other two high-cheek-boned, pasty-faced\\r\\nsoldiers seemed to take his place. Masses had also worked round on their\\r\\nright and left flanks and rear.The position was desperate. All cohesion was lost; the men were acting\\r\\ntogether in tens and sixes, or even singly. Every man had set his teeth\\r\\nand determined to fall where he stood. The British had their backs to\\r\\nthe wall; they knew that on them depended the fate of the army, of the\\r\\nwhole expedition; defeat meant disaster, so they fought on till they\\r\\ndied.Jack and Will, with two privates and a sergeant, a man of great stature,\\r\\nfought in one group, and terrible were the combats they had.Spite of all, the British had to give ground foot by foot; but they hung\\r\\non with the bull-dog tenacity of their race. Twice they were driven from\\r\\nthe Sandbag Battery, and twice did they retake it, only again to be\\r\\ndriven out. Then four officers sprang forward, waving their swords.They sprang in among the foe, and for a moment no one followed. Two were\\r\\nat once slain. Then Jack ran forward. ‘They will all be killed!’ he\\r\\ncried. ‘To the rescue!’A rush followed, the Russians were driven back, the bayonets went to\\r\\nwork till they dripped blood, and the battery was again in British\\r\\nhands, though{283} at a terrible cost. But now the ammunition failed, and\\r\\nmen cried out to General Adams to ask what they should do.‘You have still your bayonets, boys,’ he replied; and with these they\\r\\nfought on. But numbers told; and, unsupported as they were, they had to\\r\\nfall back, carrying their wounded with them, for they had seen that day\\r\\nthat the Russians brained or bayoneted every wounded man they saw.While they were sullenly retreating, General Adams received a mortal\\r\\nwound, and a cry of sorrow went up from the men. Then suddenly, three\\r\\nfield-guns behind them opened fire, and instantly the advance of the\\r\\nRussians was checked, the round-shot crashing through their ranks; but\\r\\npresently, being reinforced by yet another battalion, they again\\r\\nadvanced, moving cautiously in skirmishing order through the brushwood.\\r\\nThen the guns opened with ‘case,’ and they retreated.Soon, coming through the mist, tall black headdresses were seen, and a\\r\\ncheer went up from the sorely smitten 49th as they recognised the\\r\\nGuards. The Grenadiers were moving down grandly to the attack, and the\\r\\nremnants of the 49th and 41st, not waiting to replenish their\\r\\nammunition, but depending alone upon their bayonets, formed up and\\r\\nadvanced on the left of the Guards.Upon coming up with the enemy, the Guards tried to open fire; but the\\r\\nchambers of their rifles were wet and the caps only snapped, failing to\\r\\nexplode the cartridges.Low, angry growls burst from the Guards till a cheery voice rang out,\\r\\n‘Never mind, Grenadiers; the steel will do it.{284}’Then they brought their rifles down to the charge, and without any word\\r\\nof command dashed down upon the Russians, sweeping them from the battery\\r\\nand from the ground on its flanks. The Grenadiers used the few minutes’\\r\\nrespite they had won in drying their rifles by firing caps, and by then\\r\\nthe Russians had returned to the attack.The Guards soon found that the wall of the battery, having no\\r\\nbanquette on which the defenders might stand, though it might be a\\r\\nprotection, yet hindered them from inflicting harm on the enemy, so they\\r\\nleft it and engaged the Russians on the flank of it. Again and again did\\r\\nthey charge the countless hordes, again and again did the Sandbag\\r\\nBattery change hands, till the slain around it lay in heaps. The Scots\\r\\nFusiliers joined in the fight, and for two hours a struggle went on that\\r\\nis almost impossible to describe.The English fought mostly in grim silence; but the Russians, roused to a\\r\\nwild, religious enthusiasm, and maddened by vodka, yelled and howled\\r\\nlike demons.At last the Russians brought up an overwhelming mass of artillery, which\\r\\nopened on the defenders and so played on the slopes behind them that it\\r\\nwould have been impossible to bring up reinforcements, even were there\\r\\nany to bring; but all were engaged. Under cover of this fire, six\\r\\nthousand fresh troops were hurled against the remnants of the Guards,\\r\\nless than eight hundred strong at the beginning of the fight; and, the\\r\\nfog again lifting, the colonel of the Grenadiers saw the columns upon\\r\\ncolumns of flat-capped, white-faced soldiery, with their close-cropped\\r\\nbullet-heads, and their high cheek-bones, throwing up their right\\r\\nshoulders to outflank him. He knew the{285} Sandbag Battery was useless to\\r\\nhim, and he moved his men so as to form his line to meet the Russians.A sergeant of Grenadiers answered that question. ‘They’re the\\r\\nColdstreams, sonny’ he said; ‘now we’ll show these long-gowned\\r\\nputty-faces’—alluding to the Russians’ greatcoats, which reached to\\r\\ntheir feet—‘what stuff the Guards are made of.’The ‘long gowns,’ finding the Sandbag Battery deserted, had already\\r\\nrushed in with wild yells of delight. This sight made the Grenadiers\\r\\nchafe.‘Boys,’ said the sergeant who had just spoken to Jack and Will, ‘are we\\r\\ngoing to let the Coldstreams get back the battery? Who’ll follow me? The\\r\\nGrenadiers have held it and they’ll keep it.’With a wild cheer a hundred of them dashed down, bayoneting the\\r\\nRussians; and, before the Coldstreams came up, for the seventh time the\\r\\nSandbag Battery was retaken. Neither Jack nor Will had followed the\\r\\nimpetuous sergeant; but they took part in the forward movement which\\r\\npresently set the Okhotsk and Selinghinsk battalions reeling down the\\r\\nhill. And so the fight went on; but slowly the force of thousands\\r\\nagainst hundreds began to tell, and though every man in the British\\r\\nforce was a hero, he could not maintain for ever a struggle against odds\\r\\nten to one. Russians seemed to spring up on all sides; and, though the\\r\\nearth was cumbered with their dead and wounded, in countless hordes they\\r\\nstill came on.It presently became imperative that the Guards and the remnants of the\\r\\n49th and 41st should receive{286} reinforcements. The Duke of Cambridge\\r\\nhimself had gone some time before to find men to come to the assistance\\r\\nof his beloved Guards; but not a man had arrived.A desperate attack had just been beaten off, in which Will had received\\r\\na blow on the head from the butt-end of a rifle which had laid him\\r\\nsenseless for a few minutes.Jack was kneeling beside his injured comrade when a mounted officer\\r\\ntapped his shoulder with his blood-stained sword.‘Sergeant,’ he said, ‘I’ve several times noticed you and your comrade\\r\\nto-day using a rifle and bayonet with the best of us, and you’ve done\\r\\ngood service, though how on earth you got here I can’t tell.’‘Well, it was a lucky chance, and you can render us further service if\\r\\nyou will. You’re a cavalryman. Mount my horse, go back to the ridge, and\\r\\nfind General Pennefather. Ask him to send us what men he can spare,\\r\\nwe’re hard pushed.’‘I know what you’re thinking,’ said the officer; ‘but you can get your\\r\\ncomrade up before you on the mare. She’ll carry you both, and your chum\\r\\nwill be better in the rear. I can’t go myself, because my place is here\\r\\nwith my battalion. We shall have to fight for our very lives, and few if\\r\\nany of us will get out of this. When you find the General, impress upon\\r\\nhim that we are almost out of cartridges.’This amounted to an order, and so, reluctantly, Jack climbed into the\\r\\nsaddle which the major vacated; and, two stalwart Guardsmen lifting up\\r\\nWill tenderly and seating him before Jack, he turned his hors{287}e’s head\\r\\nuphill. As he went along, bullets whizzed by his ears and several times\\r\\nround-shot ploughed up the ground round him; but he reached the crest,\\r\\nand having placed Will in safety, he had the good fortune to find\\r\\nGeneral Pennefather and his staff. He delivered his message, and the\\r\\ngenial Irishman, his face aglow with pleasure at the fight he was\\r\\nenabled to wage against tremendous odds, untrammelled by superiors,\\r\\nsaid, ‘And what the dickens are you doing here?’Jack replied, and the General burst out laughing. ‘A lame excuse,\\r\\nyoungster,’ he said; ‘but any excuse that takes a man into the fight\\r\\nwill pass with me. Now we must see what men we can spare to help the\\r\\nGuards. Keep with me, Lancer, you may be useful, for many of my staff\\r\\nhave been bowled over.’Reinforcements in tens or twenties were found and formed up—men of the\\r\\n20th, 21st, and 63rd Regiments who had wandered back for ammunition; men\\r\\nwho had been in the fight and been driven back, losing their companies;\\r\\nmen who were acting as camp-guard. These men, just driblets, fell in and\\r\\nmarched to the assistance of those in the Sandbag Battery, who, from the\\r\\noccasional glimpses which could be caught of them, it was seen were\\r\\nwaging a stubborn fight.Then immense masses of the enemy emerging from the Quarry Ravine\\r\\nadvanced against the right of the Home Ridge. Perceiving the movement,\\r\\nGeneral Pennefather galloped off there, and Jack, still on the charger\\r\\nof the Guards’ officer, followed.That part of the ridge was held by four hundred men only; but they were\\r\\nmen of historic regiments, the 20th and the 57th. When the Russians\\r\\ncame{288} within striking distance the 20th delivered their fire; then, with\\r\\nthe old Minden yell, a cry practised by that regiment alone, they\\r\\nswooped down on the Russians. The colonel of the 57th bade his men\\r\\nprepare.That regiment, known since Albuera by the proud nickname of the ‘Die\\r\\nHards,’ needed no second bidding. They sprang upon the flank of the\\r\\nRussians and rolled them up; but another battalion appearing, General\\r\\nPennefather ordered both the 20th and the 57th to retire to the top of\\r\\nthe ridge, where they lay down, and with concentrated fire held the\\r\\nenemy in check.For three hours, then, the battle had waged, and everywhere, in spite of\\r\\noccasional advantages, the Russians had been defeated. A lull now\\r\\nensued; the enemy were preparing for their great final effort.The weather cleared a little, so that surrounding objects could be seen;\\r\\nand, riding behind heroic General Pennefather, Jack presently saw the\\r\\nRussians coming up the slope towards the Home Ridge in enormous columns.\\r\\nThey covered the advance of their infantry with a raging artillery fire,\\r\\nand the ridge was swept from end to end.Presently, just by Jack, the head of a Russian column gained the ridge.\\r\\nThere were no English troops in sight; but a French regiment, the 7th of\\r\\nthe line, was moving along the crest. It was smitten by the Russian\\r\\nartillery, it wavered and faltered. An English staff-officer rode up and\\r\\nharangued them in broken French. Jack, speaking the language fluently,\\r\\nalso galloped up.{289}‘Comrades, brothers, stand firm!’ he cried; ‘prove that you are the sons\\r\\nof the heroes who under the great Napoleon conquered half Europe.’The battalion advanced; but the Russians poured in a volley when they\\r\\nretreated down the hillside. The troops on the Home Ridge were in\\r\\ndanger, the victorious Russians were advancing, when two hundred men of\\r\\nthe 55th and 77th flew at the mass, charged it, tore through it from end\\r\\nto end; and the Russians, paralysed by the very audacity of the attack,\\r\\nretired down the hill. They were not defeated though; they rallied and\\r\\nreturned to the attack.The French 7th Regiment advanced; some English troops who had been\\r\\ndriven back formed up beside them. The French deployed right in the face\\r\\nof the advancing Russians. They delivered a volley and were reloading\\r\\nwhen a panic seemed to seize them. They saw the Russians would be upon\\r\\nthem before they had finished loading, and they had not that calm\\r\\nconfidence in their prowess which enables the British to charge home\\r\\nwith the bayonet. They began to fall back, when General Pennefather, in\\r\\nstrong, vigorous language, bade them stand; many of his officers did\\r\\nlikewise, and the English soldiers on their left shouted out\\r\\nencouragingly. The French soldiers listened; they took heart, but the\\r\\nRussians were then only a few paces from them.Suddenly the enemy’s leading battalions halted, and began to gaze\\r\\nnervously over their shoulders. A tremendous tumult broke out behind\\r\\nthem. They saw their supporting battalions reel and stagger, then\\r\\nweaken.The English around their General, looking from the vantage of their\\r\\nseats on horseback, saw the gallant{290} Daubeney with thirty men of the\\r\\n55th dash at the flank of the whole Russian battalion, strike in, lose\\r\\nitself in the horde of Russians; then—by stabbing, kicking, punching,\\r\\nheaving—literally tear a way through from flank to flank, throwing them\\r\\ninto fearful disorder. This disorder spread to the first battalion of\\r\\nRussians, who, thinking they were attacked by numbers, wavered.General Pennefather gave a tremendous cheer, those with him took it up;\\r\\nthe handful of English on the flank of the French sprang forward, and a\\r\\nfierce fight began. The French officers cried out, ‘Drummers to the\\r\\nfront.’In an instant they were beating a pas de charge; the French gave a\\r\\ncry, and with levelled bayonets dashed on the foe, who were driven down\\r\\nthe hill with great slaughter.The Russians this time, however, were in grave earnest. They rallied,\\r\\nand again attacked along the whole line with great vigour. But the\\r\\nBritish artillery had gained the ascendant, and was doing enormous\\r\\ndamage with two eighteen-pounders which Lord Raglan had caused to be\\r\\ndragged up to the front.The whole of the Russian battalions concentrated their fire on these\\r\\nguns; and although they struck down one-tenth of the men working them,\\r\\nso magnificently were they handled that they smashed up gun after gun of\\r\\nthe Russians and effectually quieted their fire.It was then that every available man was brought up to repel the final\\r\\nRussian attack. More French troops arrived, with them being a cavalry\\r\\nregiment, the 4th Chasseurs d’Afrique.They passed close by Jack, and to his surprise he{291} saw the remnants of\\r\\nthe Light Brigade, the whole only two hundred strong, acting in support\\r\\nof the French cavalry.Barrymore saw Jack, and immediately called him, and Jack took his place\\r\\nin the ranks. There was no time then for explanations, and he rode on\\r\\nwith his regiment till they came under a tremendous artillery fire. A\\r\\nshell burst right in amongst them, and several men and horses fell.Unfortunately both men were killed; and, several other casualties\\r\\noccurring, the cavalry was retired.The French General decided to recall his troops, for they had all met\\r\\nwith discomfiture. One regiment of Zouaves, however, remained, and with\\r\\nthe remnant of our Guards they advanced towards the Sandbag Battery.So fierce was the attack the thus allied brigade delivered that the\\r\\nRussians were hurled back against the wall. The only outlets were the\\r\\ntwo embrasures; and, encumbered by their long coats, the Russians tried\\r\\nin vain to force themselves through. They were caught in a trap and a\\r\\nterrible slaughter ensued, the pursuit following them right down to the\\r\\nQuarry Ravine.Along the whole line the British were equally successful, the Russians\\r\\nwere hurled back; and the eighteen-pounders continuing to do grand work,\\r\\nthe Russian artillery fire was gradually overcome.General Pennefather ordered a fresh advance of his handful of men, only\\r\\na few hundreds being left of his three thousand six hundred of the\\r\\nmorning.{292}Once more they advanced, once more crossed bayonets with the sulky foe,\\r\\nno longer yelling like demons, but now fighting with the stubbornness of\\r\\ndespair. Gradually they drove them back, the Russians again giving vent\\r\\nto that wailing cry of despair that had been heard on the heights of the\\r\\nAlma.About one o’clock a staff officer with Lord Raglan observed the Russians\\r\\nbeginning to withdraw their artillery; then the news flew round that the\\r\\nenemy acknowledged his defeat, and at last the battle, the great\\r\\n‘Soldiers’ Battle,’ was won.A mass of two thousand men, all gathered closely together, formed to\\r\\ncover the retreat of the Russian artillery. The eighteen-pounders were\\r\\nturned upon them, and the balls tore through, carrying cruel destruction\\r\\nwith them.The moment had arrived for pursuit; but the fasting British were too\\r\\nexhausted to move, the French General refused to advance his troops\\r\\nunless the British supported him, and the Russians were allowed to fall\\r\\nsullenly back.There was no semblance of riot or disorder. The defeated battalions,\\r\\nstill in their thousands, retreated in good order.By three o’clock Mount Inkermann was free of Russians, all but the\\r\\nghastly thousands of dead and wounded.The French artillery followed the foe and did them some damage; but the\\r\\nships from the harbour opened on them, and they retreated.Night settled down in mist and fog and gloom, hiding the horrors on\\r\\nthose blood-stained slopes. By eight o’clock the last gun had passed\\r\\nback into the Russian lines of defence.It was more than likely that the timely warning they had been able to\\r\\ngive the picket of the 41st saved a surprise on the part of the Russians\\r\\nwhich might have been most awkward for the British.Jack and Will had, however, been ‘absent without leave;’ and though in\\r\\ntheir own regiment the part they had played became known, yet no\\r\\nofficial mention was made of it, for awkward questions might have been\\r\\nasked.The next morning was bright and cold, and the whole of the battlefield\\r\\ncould be seen. It was then, and only then, that the terrible nature of\\r\\nthe struggle of the day before could be realised; and it was seen that\\r\\nthe fog, though most confusing at the time, had yet been a blessing, for\\r\\nit had prevented the British from being disheartened by the tens of\\r\\nthousands who had been pitted against them, and the Russians from\\r\\ndiscovering the mere handful of British by whom they were opposed.Early in the morning shoals of people from Balaclava—Greeks, Armenians,\\r\\nTurks, sailors from the fleet, and others—came to visit the\\r\\nbattlefield, taking medals, ribbons, crucifixes, chains, and so on as\\r\\nmementos of the great fight.To prevent this the cavalry were ordered to turn{295} out as patrols, and to\\r\\nkeep every one off the battlefield but those engaged there. All day long\\r\\nJack and Will were thus engaged, and a terrible duty it was.‘It’s worse than fighting,’ said Jack. ‘Just look there, Will, where we\\r\\nfought so long at the Sandbag Battery. The dead are literally in\\r\\nheaps—see, eight deep! English, Russians, and French, all one on top of\\r\\nthe other!’The groans and cries of the wounded as they were borne past were\\r\\nheart-rending. The Russians lay around in thousands, and it seemed as if\\r\\nthe task of gathering them in would never finish. The wounded were seen\\r\\nto first, being carried to the hospital tents. The dead Russians were\\r\\nplaced side by side in long trenches. Even while thus engaged, the enemy\\r\\non several occasions opened fire from Sebastopol on the burying-parties,\\r\\nmuch to the indignation of officers and men.On the second day Jack’s regiment had to go down to Balaclava for\\r\\nstores. Near the town they heard the cheery tones of a band playing\\r\\n‘Cheer, boys, cheer!’ the words of which the men were singing, and saw\\r\\nan infantry regiment, just landed, marching up to the front.The fresh-coloured, smart-looking lads were cheering loudly, for they\\r\\nhad heard of the glorious victory of Inkermann. Presently they came\\r\\nabreast of the Lancers, and they stared hard at the handful of war-worn,\\r\\ntattered, bearded, dirty horsemen, with battered caps and rusty arms.\\r\\nOne youngster said to another as they passed Jack, ‘What troops are\\r\\nthese, Bill, old man?’‘Crikey, Bill!’ said the first speaker, ‘they ain’t much to look at; a\\r\\nwash ’u’d do ’em good,’ at which there was a laugh, and several of the\\r\\ntroopers who had ridden down the Valley of Death coloured redly.‘Poor fellows!’ said Barrymore to Jack, ‘wait till they’ve been in the\\r\\nCrimea a fortnight and taken a turn at trench and picket duty, they’ll\\r\\nunderstand things a bit then.’The work in the trenches was being pushed forward rapidly; but there was\\r\\nno longer any hope that Sebastopol could be taken by assault. True, the\\r\\nRussians had lost heart over Inkermann, and it was doubtful whether they\\r\\ncould again be got—at least for months—to come out in the open and\\r\\nface the English, and all felt that the siege must be a long and\\r\\nprotracted affair.The losses in the trenches and from sickness were nearly a hundred a\\r\\nday, and the handful of men before Sebastopol knew that unless speedy\\r\\nreinforcements arrived they would be absolutely at the mercy of the\\r\\nenemy. A week after Inkermann, had the Russians attempted another sortie\\r\\nthe result might have been different.‘I believe we shall have to winter here,’ said Will to Jack one night as\\r\\nthey shiveringly turned into their tent.‘It’s easy to do that, sitting before a cosy fire after a good dinner,\\r\\nyour feet in slippers, a book in your hand, and’——‘For goodness’ sake shut up, Jack, or I shall murder you,’ said Will,\\r\\n‘to draw such a picture with us here, hungry, cold, and wet, with\\r\\nnothing but the sodden ground to sleep on. Ugh, it’s awful!’Jack and Will occupied a tent together. Since Balaclava all troop\\r\\ndistinctions had been lost. The handful of survivors formed themselves\\r\\ninto one regiment, the men of different corps making troops. Since that\\r\\nday in the North Valley the survivors seemed drawn together by a mutual\\r\\nbond of sympathy, and in place of the jealousy often existing between\\r\\nregiments there was a feeling of good-fellowship.On the particular night on which Will had his grumble it poured with\\r\\nrain, and the canvas getting saturated, the water soon began to leak\\r\\nthrough. Jack and Will wrapped their cloaks round them to keep some of\\r\\nthe rain off, and so inured to hardships were they that they managed to\\r\\nsleep.About five o’clock, however, they were both awakened by the streams of\\r\\nwater which flowed underneath the flaps of the tent and were saturating\\r\\nthem. Cold and miserable, they both sat up, listening to the wind\\r\\nhowling through the camp. It got louder and louder; the sides of the\\r\\ntent began to rise and flutter, the rain driving right into the lads’\\r\\nfaces. The cords creaked and the pole began to bend.Snap—crash! the pole of the tent had broken off close to the ground,\\r\\nand Jack and Will were struggling under a heap of wet, cold canvas.\\r\\nPainfully, and at considerable risk, they fought their way out, and at\\r\\nlast stood erect.Heavens, what a sight met their gaze! Nearly every tent was down; many\\r\\nwere being whirled sky-high in the blast; others covered the struggling\\r\\nforms of their former occupants. Men in every state of dress and undress\\r\\nwere to be seen, some trying to chase their belongings, others having as\\r\\nmuch as they could do to stand up against the blast, many only staring\\r\\nblankly at each other. All round was a sea of mud; this was picked up by\\r\\nthe wind, and being whirled along soon covered everybody and everything\\r\\nwith a wet, freezing coating of earth.Everything that Jack and Will possessed was under the wreck of their\\r\\ntent, and they fought manfully to rescue some of their things. Jack at\\r\\nlast got his boots; but he had to sit down in mud almost to his waist to\\r\\nput them on. His fur-jacket, spoil from the convoy at Mackenzie’s Farm,\\r\\nhe also got, and his dress-cap. Will rescued part of his things too;\\r\\nthen the wind picked up the tent and whirled it away.Tentless, Jack and Will looked around them. A captain of Hussars, in his\\r\\nshirt only, was tearing after a pair of overalls, which he at last\\r\\ncaptured only to find they were not his own. Men everywhere were{299}\\r\\nchasing articles, while the air was filled with headdresses, caps,\\r\\ncoats, wet blankets, even pieces of furniture from the officers’ tents.And still the force of the wind increased. Wagons were overturned; the\\r\\nhorses were knocked down and rolled over, then getting up, they broke\\r\\nloose from the picket-ropes and rushed madly out over the plain. The\\r\\nskies were leaden-coloured, the wind howled fiercer and fiercer; snow,\\r\\nsleet, rain all fell together; every one was soon knee-deep in mud.Presently a cry arose, ‘The hospital-tent is down!’ and this was seen to\\r\\nbe the case. Hundreds of poor fellows suffering from ghastly wounds\\r\\nreceived at Inkermann and in the trenches since were exposed to all the\\r\\nfury of that dreadful storm, and many succumbed.All who were able to stand fought their way over to the hospital-tent,\\r\\nand, moving up to their knees in mud, lashed by the storm, they helped\\r\\nto carry the poor, uncomplaining fellows behind walls, into barns and\\r\\nstables, anywhere, so that they could get a little shelter until the\\r\\nfury of the elements abated.All the morning Jack and Will worked at the hospital; and when they had\\r\\nfinished, a good-hearted doctor took the lads into a hut which had been\\r\\nerected for his stores, and there gave them a hot cup of tea\\r\\neach—luxury of luxuries—some beef and ration-biscuits, and then a\\r\\nglass of brandy. To the doctor’s kindness the two lads always attributed\\r\\nthe fact that they took no serious harm from the effects of the storm.About midday the wind changed; it got piercingly cold, and snow fell\\r\\nheavily, soon covering everything with a mantle of white. During the\\r\\nafternoon the{300} wind abated somewhat, and some attempts were made to\\r\\nrecapture and re-erect tents; but only a few were recovered, and the\\r\\nground being literally turned to mud the pegs would not hold. A few were\\r\\ngot up by some means or other; but, the wind again rising, they were all\\r\\nblown down again.Night approached, and the storm showed but small signs of abating. Jack\\r\\nand Will, huddled up in their cloaks, wet through and through, were\\r\\nsheltering from the wind under the lee of a wall, when a sergeant of the\\r\\n8th Hussars whom both knew passed them.‘Come with me, then. I’m going up to the barn used as a stable by the\\r\\nmen of “Ours” who are Lord Raglan’s escort.’The lads gladly followed the kindly sergeant, and presently reached the\\r\\ngreat barn. Here they found a mixed company, Hussars, Lancers, linesmen,\\r\\nofficers, privates, all mixed up together, huddling round two fires\\r\\nwhich they had managed to light. There were a number of horses in the\\r\\nbarn which the smoke from the fires made very restless. It is impossible\\r\\nto describe the combination of smells in the place; but it was heaven\\r\\ncompared with outside, and thankfully Jack and Will squeezed up to a\\r\\nfire, and standing in their steaming garments thankfully accepted the\\r\\nbit of fried ration-pork offered to them, and drank a tot of rum.Dozing by fits and starts, disturbed by the constant going and coming of\\r\\ndifferent people, the neighing and stamping of the horses, and a\\r\\ntremendous cannonading opened by the Russians on the French lines,{301} they\\r\\npassed the night, and awoke in the morning to find a bright, cold sky,\\r\\nthe country covered in snow, every place ankle-deep in mud; but oh,\\r\\nblessing of blessings! the wind gone, and the sun, the genial sun,\\r\\nshining gloriously!{302}‘Oh Blair,’ he cried out, ‘I’ve been looking for you. Get saddled up as\\r\\nquickly as you can; you’ve got to go down to Balaclava with a despatch.’‘Right you are, major,’ replied Jack; ‘I’ll just scrape a few pounds of\\r\\nmud off my poor beast, then I’ll be ready.’Jack was soon on his way, and many a sad sight did he see as he went\\r\\nalong. Dozens of poor fellows who had died of exposure during that\\r\\ndreadful night were being carried off for interment. The sufferings of\\r\\nthose in the trenches had been terrible, and many a stalwart soldier had\\r\\nsuccumbed to the fury of the storm.The road to Balaclava was a mere quagmire, and Jack had to struggle\\r\\nalong through lines of ammunition-mules, artillery wagons, and so on,\\r\\nthe poor exhausted beasts being hardly able to drag the vehicles through\\r\\nthe sludge. Dead horses and cattle were scattered all over the country,\\r\\nwith the débris of the camp, personal belongings, roofs of huts, and\\r\\nshreds of tents.Balaclava itself far exceeded in filth and dirt anything that Varna had\\r\\never been. Its main street was simply a channel of mud, through which\\r\\nhorses,{303} camels, mules, soldiers, and sailors, with artillery and\\r\\ntransport-wagons, continually fought their way. The air was full of the\\r\\ncries of Turks, Arabs, Italians, Maltese, Greeks, Tartars, Bulgarians,\\r\\nall offering the worst wares at fabulous prices.From the side lanes one heard continually the cries of pain and the\\r\\nprayers of Moslem soldiers dying by dozens of cholera and other\\r\\ndiseases. Since their conduct on the 25th of October the Turks had been\\r\\ntreated with contempt by the British, and, finding no favour at the\\r\\ncamp, had made Balaclava their headquarters, where, neglected by their\\r\\nown government, they had contracted the seeds of disease and made\\r\\nBalaclava a very pest-house. The bodies of the Turks lay sometimes for\\r\\ndays where they had died. The stench in these narrow lanes was\\r\\nappalling, and the different forms of human suffering which met the\\r\\nsight at every turn enough to shock the most callous.As Jack’s horse slowly and painfully made its way down towards the\\r\\nharbour, where he had to deliver his despatch, signs of damage done by\\r\\nthe great storm met him on every side. Windows were blown in, roofs torn\\r\\noff, and at the neck of the harbour Jack saw two or three large boats\\r\\nwhich had been driven up inland and smashed to pieces. Floating on the\\r\\nwaters of the harbour were trusses of hay, heavy pieces of timber,\\r\\nbroken spars and masts, and all sorts of other things, indicating that\\r\\ngreat damage must have been done to the shipping.From those employed in the harbour Jack learnt sad news indeed. During\\r\\nthe storm twenty-one vessels had been wrecked. The new steamship\\r\\nPrince, which had arrived but a few days previously with the 46th\\r\\nRegiment, had gone down with a cargo{304} valued at half a million aboard\\r\\nher. The whole of the winter clothing sent out for the troops, and of\\r\\nwhich they were fearfully in want, was lost. Forty thousand thick suits,\\r\\nwith woollen underclothes, socks, gloves, boots, and blankets; hundreds\\r\\nand thousands of pounds of biscuit, salt-meat, coffee, and rice,\\r\\nthousands of gallons of rum; millions of pounds of forage and compressed\\r\\nhay; and millions of rounds of ball-cartridge, with all the artillery\\r\\nreserve ammunition were lost in that terrible storm.Jack was appalled at the news, and as he made his way back to camp,\\r\\nthrough a biting snow and sleet storm, it seemed as if the very elements\\r\\nthemselves were fighting for the Russians against the Allies.Those were terrible days! Rain, fog, frost, and snow, followed one\\r\\nanother in rapid succession. The winter set in with unwonted severity;\\r\\nthe camp became a quagmire, and the men in the trenches were often up to\\r\\nthe middle of their thighs in mud and slush for sixteen hours at a time.\\r\\nThe road to Balaclava was often impassable, the putrid carcasses and\\r\\nskeletons of horses, camels, and mules lay half-buried in mud from one\\r\\nend of it to the other; and for days no sugar, coffee, tea, or rum was\\r\\nissued to the troops; biscuit and meat were also scarce. There was very\\r\\nlittle in Balaclava, and it was impossible to get what was there up to\\r\\nthe camp. Thus, only half-fed, in rags, exposed to the rigour of a\\r\\nsevere climate, working often twenty hours out of the twenty-four, the\\r\\nmen broke down. Cholera raged more fiercely than ever, and things looked\\r\\nin a bad way in the camp of the Allies.The Russians gave them no peace. By day and by{305} night they kept up a\\r\\nheavy fire and made frequent sorties; but the British, with dogged\\r\\npersistence, pushed their parallels nearer and nearer, repulsed the\\r\\nsorties, and snapped their fingers at the cannonading.‘Heaven help us!’ said Jack to Will one morning about the middle of\\r\\nDecember. ‘I’m for Balaclava to-day, and my poor horse can hardly stand.\\r\\nIt’s no good saddling him, for I know he couldn’t carry me. He won’t\\r\\nlast another day, I’m sure.’‘He’ll only go the way of most of the others,’ said Will. ‘There are\\r\\nonly twenty-seven horses fit for duty left in the whole brigade.’‘I know; we lost five the night before last and three last night,’ said\\r\\nJack gloomily. ‘Will, unless we soon get big reinforcements from home,\\r\\nwith stores and warm clothing, England will wake up one morning to find\\r\\nthat her army in the Crimea is a thing of the past.’‘Serve ’em right too,’ said Will as he proceeded to twist some hay-bands\\r\\nround his legs, his overalls having been worn to tatters weeks before.\\r\\n‘Jack,’ he continued, ‘have you got a bit of that string left? I might\\r\\nbe able to tie the sole of my left boot on so that it will last for\\r\\nanother day.’Jack, who was busy sewing a patch made of a shred of old blanket on his\\r\\nown overalls, passed Will the piece of string he had brought up from\\r\\nBalaclava; then went on with his work.The boots and fur-coat he had become possessed of on the day of the\\r\\ncapture of the convoy by Mackenzie’s Farm proved of the utmost value to\\r\\nhim, and in this respect he was better off than Will.‘Thank God, poor Dainty did not live to be starved to death here,’ said\\r\\nJack as he and Will mounted, the latter going out on escort-duty with a\\r\\nmixed troop.A party of Rifles went by, many of the men having made themselves a sort\\r\\nof smock from blankets fastened round their waists with their belts,\\r\\ntheir trousers being patched with every variety of stuff, from pieces of\\r\\ncloth cut from Russian uniforms to scraps of canvas or bagging.Jack joined the squad, mostly men of the Guards, who were going down to\\r\\nBalaclava for supplies; bearded, haggard-looking fellows, whose\\r\\ngreatcoats were thick with successive layers of mud, and whose feet were\\r\\nalmost bare, but in whose eyes burned that fierce, unquenchable light\\r\\nthat spoke of a resolve to conquer or die.The journey was the same as dozens of others Jack had made, except that\\r\\nBalaclava looked filthier than ever and more full of misery. On the road\\r\\nback to camp several horses, after stumbling a few times, fell one by\\r\\none. They would lie in the mud looking up with lack-lustre eyes, their\\r\\ntongues hanging out. A few spasmodic movements of the legs, smoothing\\r\\ndown the mud, would follow, and then the poor beasts would die, being\\r\\nleft where they had fallen—a few more carcasses to rot and putrefy;\\r\\nwhile their loads would be distributed among the other animals or on the\\r\\nmen’s shoulders.December wore on and Christmas approached. Jack received letters from\\r\\nhis mother and sisters and from the Lelands. Mrs Blair’s and the girls’\\r\\nwere full of thankfulness that their dear one had escaped so far, prayed\\r\\nthat the war might soon be over, and wound up by saying they had sent\\r\\nhim a small{307} hamper which they hoped he would find useful at Christmas.\\r\\nThe hamper contained some warm shirts and socks, a bottle of brandy, a\\r\\nham, and a plum-pudding. Poor Jack could almost have cried when he read\\r\\nthe list, just the very things that would be most acceptable; but he\\r\\nknew well enough he would never see the hamper, and he never did.What became of the things sent to the soldiers during the Crimean war\\r\\nremains a mystery to this day.{308}Early in the New Year the remnants of the brigade were returning from a\\r\\nreconnaissance they had made towards Tschorgoun, where, it had been\\r\\nstated, a large Russian force was gathering.It was a bitterly cold day, with a freezing wind which penetrated the\\r\\nragged, tattered uniforms of the men and chilled them to the bone. Jack\\r\\nwas riding with his face well buried in the collar of his cloak and his\\r\\nright hand in his pocket, when he turned to Will, who was riding by his\\r\\nside, to make some remark to him. He was immediately struck by the\\r\\npallor of his friend’s face and the way in which it was drawn as though\\r\\nin agony.A staff-officer who happened to have some brandy in his flask trotted up\\r\\nand gave the bottle to Will. The spirit rather revived him, and some of\\r\\nhis companions helped him up in front of Jack, and they managed to get\\r\\nback to camp. Here Jack got Will to their tent, wrapped him up in both\\r\\ntheir blankets, which were fortunately dry; and, getting some charcoal\\r\\nfrom a man in the artillery, lit a fire.All that night Jack sat up by his friend, soothing him, rubbing him, and\\r\\nwiping the damp perspiration from his brow, while he heaped everything\\r\\nin the tent on him to keep him warm. It was a fight for poor Will\\r\\nbetween death and Jack; but morning broke and found Will still alive,\\r\\nthough insensible.Barrymore came in and brought a doctor. He looked at Will, shook his\\r\\nhead, and said,’Poor fellow! he might pull through if he had medical\\r\\ncomforts and good nursing; but here, I’m afraid, he’s booked;’ and he\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders.‘He sha’n’t die if I can help it,’ said Jack doggedly.—‘Barrymore, you\\r\\nmust get me excused from duty. I’ll nurse Will, and if mortal man can\\r\\nsave him I will.’The doctor looked admiringly at the young sergeant. ‘My poor fellow,’ he\\r\\nsaid,’you’ll only kill yourself.’The doctor went off; but in half-an-hour an orderly returned from him,\\r\\nbringing some soup, medicine, and a few instructions.All day Jack stuck to his task, and at night Barrymore helped him. In\\r\\nthe morning the kind-hearted doctor again came in.{310}‘He’s got a splendid constitution,’ he said, ‘and youth is on his side,\\r\\nor he would have been dead long since. He must be got away from here\\r\\nanyway. There’s a convoy of sick going down to Balaclava to-day for\\r\\nScutari. I’ll send round a litter for him.’Will was conscious and heard these words, and when they were alone he\\r\\nsaid feebly, ‘Jack, old man, the best chum a fellow ever had, don’t send\\r\\nme to Scutari; we’ve heard of the horrors of that place. Let me die\\r\\nhere. It makes little difference how or when we go, the few of us who\\r\\nare left.’‘No, Will; we can save you if you get into hospital. I must go back to\\r\\nmy duty to-morrow, and then there will be no one to look after you.’Later on a hospital orderly came round with a litter, and, wrapped in\\r\\nthe blankets and his own and Jack’s cloak, Will was laid upon it; then\\r\\nJack took one end of the litter and the orderly the other, when they\\r\\njoined the convoy of sick going down to Balaclava. It was a ghastly\\r\\nprocession. Some wagons contained the men wounded in the trenches during\\r\\nthe night, and these groaned terribly as they were roughly jolted along,\\r\\nwhile the blood oozed between the planks and dripped into the mud and\\r\\nsnow. Others, stricken with fever and cholera, presented a ghastly\\r\\nspectacle, with closed eyes, open mouths, and attenuated faces; only a\\r\\nthin steam of breath showing they were still alive.Some were strapped on horseback, and just in front of Jack was one poor\\r\\nfellow who, having died on the road, still sat on his horse, the staring\\r\\neyes wide open,{311} the teeth clenched on his protruding tongue, while the\\r\\nhead and body nodded with a terrible grotesqueness that filled with\\r\\nhorror those who saw it. From many of the litters protruded hands and\\r\\nfeet from which raw flesh and skin were literally hanging; these were\\r\\ncases of frost-bite.Amidst such terrible sights Jack at last got Will to Balaclava, and was\\r\\nfortunate in being able at once to get him aboard the vessel that was\\r\\nsailing that night for Scutari. Poor Will was half-insensible, and Jack\\r\\nwas spared the pain of leave-taking.‘God bless you, old boy,’ he muttered as he took a last look at his\\r\\nfriend and thought of the day when he had first seen the laughing, rosy,\\r\\nhappy-looking trumpeter in Hounslow Barracks.Jack got a mount at Balaclava, possibly the same horse on which the man\\r\\nhad died coming down; and, feeling more depressed than he had been since\\r\\nthe fatal 25th of October, he started back. Snow and sleet were driving\\r\\nin his face, and he could not see where he was going. With head bent he\\r\\nkept on, leaving his horse to find its way, he probably having made many\\r\\na journey to Balaclava before.It got very dark, and Jack reined in to look about him. He could see but\\r\\na few yards, and he did not recognise any of his surroundings. Stunted\\r\\nsnow-covered bushes were round him, and he missed the carcasses of the\\r\\nbeasts which had died on that terrible road.Heavens! the horse must have strayed! He was lost! He tried to look\\r\\nabout him; but the bits of frozen rain cut into his face and prevented\\r\\nhim from seeing more than a yard or two around him. He spurred his jaded\\r\\nhorse and went forward a little{312} quicker, vainly staring to right and\\r\\nleft. Of a sudden he saw several mounted figures in front of him. They\\r\\nmust be some stragglers riding from Balaclava to the camp, he thought;\\r\\nand, pushing forward, he hailed them. They turned, and then Jack’s heart\\r\\ngave a great thump—they were Cossacks!Immediately wheeling his horse, Jack dug in his spurs, while he wildly\\r\\nendeavoured to draw his sword, the only weapon he then carried. His\\r\\ncloak, however, was entangled round the hilt, and he could not get at\\r\\nit. Shouts behind him showed he had been recognised as an Englishman.A sharp report rang out. Jack’s horse gave a lurch, then fell heavily,\\r\\nthrowing its rider. Next moment a mounted figure dashed up, something\\r\\nbright whizzed by Jack’s shoulder, and a lance-blade ripped through his\\r\\ncloak and the sleeve of his jacket, only just grazing the flesh, but\\r\\nsticking six inches in the ground and pinning him down. He tried to free\\r\\nhimself from his wounded horse, but the lance held him too securely.In an instant half-a-dozen flat-faced Cossacks were round him, and one\\r\\nquieted Jack’s horse by placing the muzzle of his carbine in his ear and\\r\\nfiring. Then they observed how Jack was pinned down by the lance, and\\r\\nthe spectacle seemed to tickle them, for they laughed merrily. The man\\r\\nwhose lance it was, dismounting, withdrew the weapon by using both hands\\r\\nto it, standing on Jack’s body to do so. He looked at the blade, and\\r\\nseeing it bright realised that Jack was practically unhurt, on which he\\r\\ncalled out to his companions, who, dismounting, threw themselves on\\r\\nJack, tore off his cloak, which one of them promptly annexed, took his\\r\\nsword, and then with the lines thatWith a dexterity that spoke of long practice, they then searched him,\\r\\ntaking his watch and every scrap of any value which he possessed. The\\r\\ncross which the Russian count had given him, after the battle of the\\r\\nAlma, Jack had ever since worn suspended round his neck under his\\r\\njacket, thinking if ever he lived to return to England it would be a\\r\\nsouvenir to give his mother. The Cossack who ripped this from Jack’s\\r\\nneck uttered a guttural exclamation, and showed it to his companions,\\r\\nwhereupon they all began talking at once, one holding up the order in\\r\\nfront of Jack as though asking where he got it from.‘I suppose that’s what you mean, you ugly brutes,’ said Jack; ‘but I\\r\\ncan’t make you understand any more than you can make me. If I were only\\r\\nagain on poor Dainty’s back with a lance in my hand I’d make you sing\\r\\nanother tune, some of you.’The Cossacks did not, of course, understand one word of Jack’s speech;\\r\\nbut something seemed to annoy them, and two or three of them, taking the\\r\\nwhips which every Cossack carries at his saddle-bow, fell to and lashed\\r\\nJack cruelly about the head and body.‘You cowardly dogs!’ cried Jack between his clenched teeth, ‘you\\r\\ncowardly dogs! if ever I get a chance I’ll make you pay for this!’Tired of using their whips, a Cossack fastened one end of his\\r\\npicket-rope round Jack’s neck, while he secured the other end to his\\r\\nsaddle, then, having taken the saddle off the dead horse, the others\\r\\nmounted, and at a smart trot started off, Jack having as much as he\\r\\ncould do to keep up with his brutal captors.{314}Having his hands tied behind him, Jack experienced the greatest\\r\\ndifficulty in keeping up with his captors. Once or twice he slipped, but\\r\\nwas jerked up again by the rope round his neck, receiving a blow or two\\r\\nfrom the butt-end of a lance for his clumsiness.Presently they came to the banks of a river, into which the foremost\\r\\nriders at once plunged. The man who held the rope round Jack’s neck\\r\\nfollowed, and dragged his prisoner in after him. The ford was rather\\r\\ndeep and the current running strongly. About half-way across Jack lost\\r\\nhis footing, and went head-first under the icy water. His hands being\\r\\nbound he would assuredly have been drowned had not his captor spurred\\r\\nhis pony and dragged him quickly through the river and up on to the\\r\\nbank. Half-drowned, frozen to the bone, and hardly able to put one foot\\r\\nbefore the other, Jack was again jerked on to his feet, while the\\r\\nCossacks laughed heartily, as though at some rich joke.For another half-mile they went forward. Then Jack, thoroughly\\r\\ndead-beat, feeling that death was preferable to the indignities he was\\r\\nsuffering, threw himself on the ground, and in spite of blows with whips\\r\\nand lance-butts, of kicks and vituperation, doggedly refused to move.\\r\\nOne man brought the{315} point of his lance once or twice close to Jack’s\\r\\nbreast, and seemed very much inclined to make an end of him; and indeed\\r\\nhe would have done so had not he who had taken Jack’s cross, and who\\r\\nseemed to be in charge, positively forbidden it, ending up by\\r\\ndismounting and with the help of another Cossack putting Jack on his own\\r\\npony, when at a walking pace they proceeded about another mile.They then arrived at an outpost and joined the main body of Cossacks,\\r\\nseveral of whom came and stared at Jack. Some conversation took place\\r\\nbetween his captors and the others, after which the picket-rope was tied\\r\\nto a stunted tree. Some distance away the patrol had a great fire made\\r\\nunder the sheltering wall of a deserted cottage; round this fire the\\r\\nCossacks off duty gathered, eating some black bread and onions, and\\r\\ndrinking vodka. Nothing was given to Jack, who, wet through and deadly\\r\\ncold, lay shivering where he had been literally thrown.Presently a couple of horsemen approached the post, upon which the\\r\\nCossacks got up and saluted. The new-comers were evidently officers, and\\r\\nthe man who had taken Jack’s cross handed it to one of them, talking\\r\\nvolubly all the while. A minute later Jack’s rope was untied from the\\r\\ntree, and he was dragged before the Cossack officer.Recognition was mutual, and Jack saw he had before him the man of the\\r\\nTartar village and the man with whom Linham had been engaged on the day\\r\\nof Balaclava. The fellow scowled most ferociously at Jack; then holding\\r\\nup the cross, talked at a great rate, winding up by striking Jack in the\\r\\nface with his open palm.Exasperated beyond all measure at the brutal treat{316}ment he had received,\\r\\nJack, whose hands were still tied, kicked out and caught the Cossack\\r\\ncaptain on the shin. The fellow gave an angry exclamation, and drawing a\\r\\npistol, presented it at Jack’s chest and pulled the trigger. Only a\\r\\nclick followed, and the Cossack, looking at his weapon and finding it\\r\\nwas not loaded, hurled it at Jack’s head.Jack looked at this second man. He was a tall, handsome, but\\r\\nsinister-looking fellow, with fair hair and moustache. He was dressed in\\r\\na Hussar uniform all crimson, elaborately laced with gold. A dark-green\\r\\nfur-lined cloak, fastened at the neck with a gold clasp, hung down to\\r\\nhis spurred heels, while a black busby with a tall green plume adorned\\r\\nhis head. His uniform was almost new, and he looked a great dandy. He\\r\\nwas smoking a choice cigarette, and as he daintily knocked off the ash\\r\\nJack noticed that several rings glittered on his long white fingers.Hearing him speak French, Jack burst out in an indignant tone. ‘I am a\\r\\nBritish soldier, captured bearing arms, and I demand the same treatment\\r\\nfrom you that we extend to Russian prisoners of war! I have been treated\\r\\nworse than a dog or a spy!’‘You are Captain Kirchoff’s prisoner, not mine,’ he said, stirring the\\r\\nfire with the end of his sword-scabbard.The Cossack captain, whose name appeared to be Kirchoff, jabbered for a\\r\\nfew moments at Jack in Russian; then two troopers seized him and again\\r\\nbound him to his tree. Some black bread and onions{317} and some raw spirit\\r\\nwere, however, given to him, and, one of his hands being freed, he ate\\r\\nheartily.Kirchoff and the Hussar, mounting, rode off, and as they passed Jack the\\r\\nlatter said to the Cossack, ‘You might as well hang the poor devil at\\r\\nonce as let him be frozen to death.’And during that terrible night such seemed likely to be Jack’s fate. In\\r\\nthe biting blast his threadbare clothes froze on his body, while the\\r\\nsnow fell and half-covered him. He ached to the very bones, and had he\\r\\nbeen left where he was the whole night must of a certainty have been\\r\\nfrozen to death. The men who had captured Jack, though, had to go out to\\r\\nrelieve their companions. These on their return stamped round the\\r\\nblazing fire for a minute; then, seeming more humane than their\\r\\ncomrades, they undid Jack’s bonds, tying only his legs, and bringing him\\r\\nnear to the blazing fire, laid him down, covering him with a sheepskin.\\r\\nOne man gave him a drink of vodka, and the fiery spirit, though it\\r\\nmade Jack cough and splutter, probably saved his life.Sometimes dozing, sometimes half-delirious, Jack passed the hours till\\r\\ndawn. The picket was again relieved, and the same men who had captured\\r\\nJack were again enjoying an off-duty spell.The Cossacks prepared breakfast, which they disposed of, and lit their\\r\\npipes, offering Jack nothing. He was wondering how long he would have to\\r\\nendure his present treatment, when the galloping of horses was heard.\\r\\nSeveral men dashed up to the fire, and one, dismounting, made straight\\r\\nfor Jack, bending down and looking in his face. He gave way to an\\r\\nexclamation of annoyance, then said a few words in haughty tones.{318}The Cossacks, who on his approach had sprung to their feet and\\r\\nuncovered, instantly cut Jack’s bonds.‘My friend! my preserver!’ cried the young officer in French, taking\\r\\nboth Jack’s hands as he was lifted to his feet; ‘to think you should\\r\\nhave been treated thus!’Jack, who felt half-dazed, and whose legs were terribly cramped, would\\r\\nhave fallen to the ground, but the officer caught him in his arms.‘Courage! courage!’ he said; ‘you shall soon be more comfortable, and\\r\\nthese dogs who have dared to use a British soldier thus shall smart for\\r\\nit.’Jack shook his head, when the officer removed his cap and opening his\\r\\ncloak showed the white uniform beneath.‘I am Count Pauloff, he whom you saved at the Alma,’ he said. ‘I gave\\r\\nyou this,’ and he held up the cross which Kirchoff had taken away the\\r\\nnight before.Four of them who had beaten Jack with their whips and lance-butts stood\\r\\nby the fire, pale with fear, for though they could not understand French\\r\\nthey seemed to guess at the impending storm.{319}The count uttered a few words in a terrible voice, and one of the guilty\\r\\nCossacks called two others to him. Then the count gave another curt\\r\\norder, six of his orderly Dragoons, big men in dark-green, with tall,\\r\\nred felt shakos, dismounted; the wretched Cossacks were seized and their\\r\\nupper garments stripped off them. The Dragoons, who seemed to enjoy the\\r\\ntask, then taking some of the Cossacks’ whips, laid them about the men’s\\r\\nshoulders till they howled again with pain.‘We need not wait to see this,’ said the count to Jack; ‘my men will\\r\\ncarry out their task properly. Now, are you able to sit a horse?’Jack was wrapped in the coat of one of the Dragoons, mounted on his\\r\\nhorse, and they rode off at once for Sebastopol.On the way the count told Jack how he came to know what had happened to\\r\\nhim. He was one of Prince Mentschikoff’s aides-de-camp, he said, and he\\r\\nhad been on duty at daybreak that morning. Captain Kirchoff, of the\\r\\nBlack Sea Cossacks, had come in to make his report; but the Prince was\\r\\nengaged and he had to wait. He entered into conversation with Count\\r\\nPauloff, and in a blustering, braggart fashion told a tale of having met\\r\\nseveral English cavalrymen, of having killed two and taken one prisoner.\\r\\nOn his prisoner he had found a golden cross, which the English soldier\\r\\nhad admitted having taken from a dead or wounded Russian officer on the\\r\\nfield of Inkermann. Kirchoff had the man a prisoner, and{320} was going to\\r\\nbring him into Sebastopol when his men were relieved at noon that day.Though personally disliking Captain Kirchoff, Count Pauloff had been\\r\\ninterested in the tale, and when Kirchoff produced the cross in proof of\\r\\nhis words had taken it in his hands to examine it. To his intense\\r\\nsurprise he had then recognised his own cross, which he had given to\\r\\nJack on the day of the Alma. He had immediately taxed Kirchoff with\\r\\nfalsehood; but the man had persisted, though with evident signs of\\r\\nconfusion.Count Pauloff had then demanded to be instantly informed where the\\r\\nprisoner was; and the count, taking the cross and mounting a dozen\\r\\nDragoons, galloped off, finding Jack as described.‘And now I must settle with Captain Kirchoff,’ said the count sternly.\\r\\n‘A thief of a Cossack must not lie with impunity to a hereditary\\r\\nnobleman.’Entering Sebastopol, they made for the military prison, where it was\\r\\nnecessary for Jack’s name, regiment, and other particulars to be entered\\r\\non the prison books. While this was being done Count Pauloff sent an\\r\\norderly to find Captain Kirchoff and bring him at once to the prison.Meanwhile the count had armed himself with a Russian artillery driver’s\\r\\nwhip, a terrible-looking weapon.Jack was still undergoing his examination when Captain Kirchoff appeared\\r\\nin the large room in which they all were. The count immediately strode\\r\\nup, addressed rapidly some words to him, and then, without further\\r\\nparley, held him by the collar while he unmercifully lashed him with the\\r\\nwhip.Jack, who for some time had been feeling more and{321} more ill, took but\\r\\nlittle notice of the occurrence; and when, tired of thrashing Kirchoff,\\r\\nthe count turned towards him his voice sounded far away.Jack had some dim idea of being led away, supported by gentle hands;\\r\\nthen he grew drowsy and thought he fell asleep, when all became dark and\\r\\ndreamy.{322}The room was dimly lighted by a handsome lamp, and the cheery flickering\\r\\nof a large fire cast fantastic shadows upon the massive polished\\r\\nfurniture.Jack was conscious of a curious inability to move, of a sense of languor\\r\\nnot altogether unpleasant. He seemed to have been asleep a long time,\\r\\nand to have been troubled with dreams—dreams of the cholera camp at\\r\\nVarna, of the death-ride in the North Valley, of the struggle in the fog\\r\\nat Inkermann, of Linham and Will and Pearson, of his mother and sisters.\\r\\nStrange people seemed to flit about in his dreams: the count, a\\r\\nwhite-haired old gentleman, a stately lady, and a young girl who looked\\r\\nat him always with anxious eyes. The room, too, seemed familiar, though\\r\\nwhat it all meant Jack could not tell.Presently he fancied he was still lying on the cold, wet ground at Old\\r\\nFort, then in the caves of Inkermann; then he ceased to think, lamplight\\r\\nand firelight grew dimmer and dimmer, and at last vanished altogether.Next it was broad daylight, with a wintry sun shining through the\\r\\ncurtains, and Jack awoke to realise that he really was in bed in a\\r\\nstrange place, and that he felt as weak as a baby. He tried to sit{323} up\\r\\nand get out of bed; but, utterly unable to do so, he fell back with a\\r\\ndeep groan. Then there sounded a rustle of garments, and a stout,\\r\\nkind-faced woman, dressed like a nun, wearing a crucifix on her bosom\\r\\nand beads round her waist, got up from a chair by the bedside, uttered\\r\\nkind, soothing words in a tongue Jack guessed was Russian, smoothed his\\r\\npillows, and gently laid him back upon them.Then Jack remembered more—he had been taken prisoner by Cossacks. Count\\r\\nPauloff had found him and taken him to the prison at Sebastopol. Well,\\r\\nRussian prisons were splendid places thought Jack, looking round him,\\r\\nand their attendants were more than kind.Then some warm milk, flavoured with something very nice, was given him;\\r\\nthe good nun gently bathed his face and hands, and Jack wanted to talk.\\r\\nHe tried his kind nurse with French and English; but she only smiled\\r\\ngently and shook her head. And so Jack lay quietly thinking until he\\r\\nhappened to catch sight of his own hand and arm. Heavens! it was only\\r\\nskin and bone; in one day he seemed to have turned into a skeleton!This gave him fresh food for thought, and his mystification was growing\\r\\ndeeper when his nurse murmured something, among which Jack thought he\\r\\ncaught the name Irma, when a soft footstep approached the bed and a\\r\\nyoung girl of exceeding beauty, gladness beaming from her eyes, took\\r\\nJack’s hand, saying softly in French, ‘Good-morning, monsieur, welcome\\r\\nback to life! It has been a hard struggle, but you have conquered.’The features of the young girl did not seem altogether strange, though\\r\\nJack could not for the{324} moment recollect where he had seen them before.\\r\\nSomething of his uncertainty must have showed in his face, for the girl\\r\\ncontinued, ‘You are wondering where you are, how you got here, and who I\\r\\nam?’‘I confess, mademoiselle, I am puzzled. At first I thought I was in the\\r\\nprison at Sebastopol; but’—— and Jack looked round him.The girl laughed gaily. ‘You think more of where you are than of\\r\\nanything else,’ she said. ‘Well, you are in the house of Count Pauloff;\\r\\nhe brought you here from Sebastopol.’‘Ha! now I know who you are. You must be the count’s sister; you are so\\r\\nmuch alike, yet so much more handsome’—— Then Jack checked himself and\\r\\nblushed; but Irma, for such was her name, seemed by no means displeased.‘Ah that dreadful day, when poor Alexis was wounded and would have been\\r\\nslain but for you!’ and Irma covered her face with her hands as though\\r\\nto shut out some disagreeable vision.‘Monsieur,’ said Irma, ‘you have been very, very ill; we long despaired\\r\\nof saving your life. We have watched you day and night. You have been\\r\\ndelirious all the time, and talking, oh, so much! till our hearts ached\\r\\nfor you. We could not understand one word you said; but we thought you\\r\\ncalled always for mother—mother.’ She pronounced it ‘mauzher.’ ‘Tell\\r\\nme, who is “mauzher”?’Irma smiled, and said artlessly, ‘Ah, I am glad! After some days the\\r\\ndoctor said you would live; but you had to be kept very quiet, and now\\r\\nhere you are. The fever has left you, and all you have to do is to get\\r\\nstrong again.’‘You fainted right away in the hospital in Sebastopol, and then grew\\r\\ndelirious. The doctors there said you must die; but Alexis had you\\r\\nwrapped in blankets, and, borrowing a carriage, drove you here, and—we\\r\\nhave nursed you.’The nurse then came forward and spoke gently to Irma, who smilingly said\\r\\nto Jack, ‘Sister Katrin says I must not talk to you any more now; but I\\r\\nshall come back presently. I sit some hours by your bedside every day.’And later on she came back with her mother, the countess, a tall,\\r\\nstately, white-haired lady. In the evening came the young Count Alexis,\\r\\nwho was over{326}joyed that Jack was at last on the highroad to recovery.Having once turned the corner, Jack began rapidly to improve, and in a\\r\\nweek was able to sit up for an hour or two, wrapped in a costly\\r\\ndressing-gown and wearing slippers of the count’s.What on earth he was going to do for clothes puzzled him, for it would\\r\\nbe impossible for him to wear the mud-and-blood-stained rags he had been\\r\\ncaptured in.But Count Pauloff had no idea of sending Jack to Sebastopol; and a day\\r\\nor two later he settled the clothes question in a very simple manner.‘I’ve got my uniform as a cadet at the Military College,’ he said; ‘it\\r\\nwill just about fit you.’ And he went away, presently returning with a\\r\\nhandsome dark-green uniform trimmed with silver lace, with cap, boots,\\r\\nbelts, all complete; and when Jack was dressed he looked a handsome\\r\\nfigure in the Russian uniform.‘That we will soon settle;’ and, touching the bell, the count bade the\\r\\nservant request his valet to attend.That obsequious gentleman was a Frenchman, and on his appearance the\\r\\ncount bade him cut Jack’s hair.{327}He insisted then on taking Jack to the drawing-room, where he was\\r\\nreceived by the countess and Irma with the utmost cordiality and quite\\r\\non terms of equality.That evening was the beginning of several happy weeks for Jack, who felt\\r\\nhimself growing daily stronger.Waited on hand, foot, and finger, treated as a dear friend or relative\\r\\nby the count’s family, and living on the choicest fare, who could fail\\r\\nto be happy, especially after the experiences Jack had passed through\\r\\nduring the last twelve months?It became apparent at once to Jack that the countess idolised her\\r\\ndaughter, and that all the servants did the same. Irma was a self-willed\\r\\nand imperious young lady, and governed everybody except the count, who,\\r\\nhowever, seldom thwarted any wish of hers, for brother and sister were\\r\\ndevotedly attached to one another.Now Irma and Jack spent the greater part of every day in each other’s\\r\\nsociety, and it would have been evident to any one less modest than was\\r\\nJack that the young Russian lady had a warm regard for the English\\r\\nsoldier.As they wandered about the summer mansion of the Pauloffs, where the\\r\\nfamily stayed on so as to be near Alexis, by adroit questioning Irma got\\r\\nfrom Jack the whole of his history; not that Jack wanted much coaxing,\\r\\nas it proved a convenient topic on which to talk.The mansion had very extensive grounds, which were surrounded by a high\\r\\nwall in which were several gates, one opening out into the forest, which\\r\\non one side came right down to the walls. In this forest,{328} Irma and Jack\\r\\nhad many a gallop on horseback, an exercise in which, on one or two\\r\\noccasions when he was able to snatch a day’s leave, they were joined by\\r\\nthe count. Always, however, whether he accompanied them or not, a sort\\r\\nof retainer of the family, a head servant named Sergius, rode behind\\r\\nthem.Sergius was devoted to his young master and to Irma. For Jack he seemed\\r\\nto have a genuine regard; but, like the true Russian domestic, he never\\r\\nbetrayed his feelings either one way or the other. It was a noticeable\\r\\nfact, though, that whenever he rode abroad with Jack he carried both\\r\\nsword and pistols, not that Jack, despite his longing to be again with\\r\\nhis comrades in the field, ever thought of repaying the kindness he had\\r\\nreceived from the Pauloffs by trying to escape from their custody.In the evenings they had cards or music, and Jack, being a very fair\\r\\nperformer on the pianoforte, played duets with Irma or sang some of the\\r\\nsongs which had been popular in England before the war. Then there were\\r\\nlessons from Irma in Russian and lessons from Jack in English, so that\\r\\ntime passed like a dream.But Jack knew the life of idleness and luxury he was leading would unfit\\r\\nhim for those duties which he would have to perform when he got back to\\r\\nthe regiment; and, spite of the terrible sufferings which he heard the\\r\\nothers were undergoing, he wished he were back again among them, sharing\\r\\nthe danger and the glory. Once or twice he had led up to this subject\\r\\nwith Count Pauloff; but the latter had always adroitly turned the\\r\\nconversation.A few days after his last attempt, a dinner-party was given at the\\r\\nchâteau, and the young count brought several officers from Sebastopol.\\r\\nAmong{329} others was a Hussar in a magnificent crimson uniform, having a\\r\\ndark-green pelisse richly laced with gold. The count, in introducing\\r\\nJack, alluded to him as ‘My cousin, Colonel Vladimir Sominoff.’Jack immediately recognised him as the Hussar who had been with Kirchoff\\r\\non the night he had been captured; but Sominoff, hardly giving Jack a\\r\\nglance, just nodded slightly and passed him by. Jack was relieved to\\r\\nthink he had not been recognised; but presently he heard Count Pauloff\\r\\nrelating how Jack had saved his life at the Alma, how later he had been\\r\\ncaptured by Kirchoff, and how the count had rescued him.During the evening Sominoff paid Irma very great attention. She,\\r\\nhowever, received his advances with great coolness. The handsome Hussar\\r\\nstroked his moustache and pretended not to notice this treatment; but\\r\\nthere was a look in his eye that Jack did not like, and later on in the\\r\\nevening, when Irma seated herself on a divan in one corner of the room\\r\\nwith him, and told him who all the people were, he glanced up to see\\r\\nColonel Sominoff regarding him with a look that quite made him start.Seeing Colonel Sominoff glaring at Jack, Irma said, ‘Oh, that’s my\\r\\ncousin Vladimir; he pesters me to death with his odious attentions, but\\r\\nI hate him. Alexis says he is careful to keep as far from danger as he\\r\\ncan, which means he is a coward, and I am sure he is a bully as well, in\\r\\nspite of his cat-like manners.’After that Colonel Vladimir Sominoff was a frequent visitor at the\\r\\nchâteau, and he kept by Irma’s side all{330} the while he was in the house.\\r\\nJack he simply ignored, never addressing a word to him, and treating him\\r\\nas if he did not exist. Sometimes the count came with the colonel, but\\r\\nmore often the latter came alone.On one occasion the colonel and the count came to spend a few days at\\r\\nthe mansion, and Jack determined to keep in the apartments which he\\r\\noccupied. This, however, Irma did not let him do.‘Why do you shut yourself up here?’ she cried with a little stamp of her\\r\\nfoot, while her dark eyes shone angrily.‘Intrude, intrude! who has dared say you intrude?’ she cried fiercely.\\r\\n‘If any of the servants’—— and her eyes blazed ominously.‘No one has said a word,’ interrupted Jack hastily; ‘but your brother\\r\\nand your cousin are here. You are quite a little family circle,\\r\\nand—and’——‘No, a thousand times no,’ said Jack; ‘but can you not understand? You\\r\\nare of the aristocracy. I am a plain English soldier; I cannot mix on an\\r\\nequality with you, and it is better that I should not. This life is\\r\\nunfitting me for my career. I shall never forget your kindness; but the\\r\\nlonger I remain here the harder I shall find it when I go. At any moment\\r\\nI may be taken off to prison’——‘You won’t,’ cried Irma. ‘Alexis has promised me that you shall not be\\r\\ntaken from here if he can help it; and he can help it—he shall. He is a\\r\\nfriend of Prince Mentschikoff.{331}’At this point Irma burst into a flood of tears. ‘You are unkind; you are\\r\\nungrateful!’ she sobbed. ‘We have done all we could for you, and you\\r\\nrepay us by saying you hope you will soon go.’Irma’s tears were more than Jack could bear. He felt he was making a\\r\\nmuddle of things. Ungrateful! Why, if he lived a hundred years he would\\r\\nnever forget their kindness!‘Countess,’[7] he said, ‘you do not understand. It is duty calls me, not\\r\\ninclination. I am a soldier and’——The door was suddenly flung violently open, and Vladimir Sominoff rushed\\r\\nin. ‘So, dog, scum!’ he hissed, ‘you dare to lay finger on a daughter of\\r\\nthe house of Pauloff;’ and he struck at Jack.Irma, however, threw herself in front of him. ‘Touch him if you dare!’\\r\\nshe cried, her eyes blazing like those of a tigress.Sominoff choked back his rage and gave vent to a mocking laugh. ‘Stand\\r\\naside,’ he said, seizing her by the wrist, ‘the countess shall talk to\\r\\nyou. I will settle with this clod.’‘Coward, you hurt me!’ she cried in cutting tones; ‘but it is only what\\r\\none might expect from a man who would leave a helpless prisoner to be\\r\\nfrozen to death on a winter’s night.’This allusion to Jack maddened Sominoff. He must have squeezed her\\r\\nwrist, for she screamed out.{332} Next moment, however, the gaudily\\r\\nuniformed Hussar was sprawling on the floor, dashed there by a blow from\\r\\nJack’s fist.With a hoarse cry he leapt to his feet, and tearing his sword from the\\r\\nscabbard rushed on Jack. The latter snatched up a chair and stood facing\\r\\nthe infuriated Russian.‘Leave us, countess,’ Jack said; ‘I think I can give this feather-bed\\r\\ndandy a lesson in swordsmanship that will lower his pride.{333}’He took in the position in one glance, and, stepping between his cousin\\r\\nand Jack, began to talk rapidly in Russian. Irma joined in the\\r\\nconversation, speaking vehemently, stamping her foot and looking from\\r\\none to the other with heightened colour and flashing eyes.Vladimir Sominoff answered angrily at first; then, mastering his temper,\\r\\nhe spoke more calmly, a sneer upon his lips the while.Jack stood aloof, and from the little Russian which he had learnt from\\r\\nIrma he was able to gather that the count was upbraiding his cousin for\\r\\nhaving made a scene, while Irma poured contumely upon him with great\\r\\nzeal.Presently all three left the room, Sominoff going first, and the count\\r\\ntaking his sister’s arm. She apparently wanted to speak to Jack before\\r\\nshe went; but the count, with his hand on the handle of the door bowed\\r\\nher out, then himself retired, shutting and locking the door behind him.Jack dropped into a chair. ‘By Jove!’ he muttered, ‘here’s a pretty\\r\\nkettle of fish. I’m sorry for the count. It would have been better if\\r\\nMiss Irma had left me to my own devices. As for that popinjay{334} Sominoff,\\r\\nI’d like to make him stand up before me for ten minutes with bare\\r\\nfists!’Late that night old Sergius, with a perfectly imperturbable air,\\r\\nappeared and asked Jack if there was anything he required before he\\r\\nretired to rest.Jack replied that there was nothing; but bade him carry his respectful\\r\\nsalutation to the count and countess and the Lady Irma.Without moving a muscle of his face, Sergius retired, and Jack could not\\r\\nhelp thinking that the old man, at his master’s bidding, would as calmly\\r\\ncut a guest’s throat as offer him a glass of wine.In the morning the count appeared. At first he seemed much annoyed, and\\r\\ntalked coldly on various subjects.Jack, who felt very sorry for him, treated him with the utmost courtesy,\\r\\nand presently the count referred to the occurrence of the afternoon\\r\\nbefore.Jack expressed his regret at the affair, and said how distasteful it was\\r\\nto him to be mixed up in what was really a family squabble.‘My dear count, is it not absurd for him to be jealous of a plain\\r\\nEnglish sergeant of Lancers. Has he such a poor opinion of the daughter\\r\\nof one of the oldest families in Russia?’‘The worst of it is,’ he said, rather shamefacedly, ‘my sister is young\\r\\nand very impressionable. She met you under somewhat romantic\\r\\ncircumstances on the day of the Alma; then you came here at the point of\\r\\ndeath, and she pitied you. You are really a gentleman, though you choose\\r\\nto serve in the ranks of your{335} army. You two have been thrown much\\r\\ntogether, and’——‘My dear count, it is time I went. I will not stay here to embarrass\\r\\nyou. Send me at once to Sebastopol.’‘That I will never do,’ cried the count vehemently, ‘if only to thwart\\r\\nVladimir; and, besides, Irma will not hear of it. I have tried to get\\r\\nyou exchanged; but, unfortunately, you are—er’——‘Exactly, and for some reason Prince Mentschikoff is obdurate. I fear\\r\\nVladimir, who possesses much influence with him, has been using it\\r\\nagainst you. I will, however, see what I can do for you to-day.\\r\\nMeanwhile it would be better if you kept to the house, or at least the\\r\\ngrounds. I—er—forgot to mention that I have pledged my word for your\\r\\nsafe custody.’Jack understood the delicately inferred hint. ‘Do not fear, count, that\\r\\nI could ever think of repaying your kindness by escaping,’ he said.‘And I implore you not to attempt it. The whole country swarms with our\\r\\nmen, and capture would be certain. Then it would be Siberia for you,\\r\\neven if nothing worse happened.’When the count had departed a servant came to Jack’s room with a\\r\\nmessage, saying that the countess desired to see him. He at once went,\\r\\nand found Irma and her mother together.The elder lady greeted him kindly, the younger with marked cordiality.\\r\\nSoon Irma carried Jack off to the grounds, and they were at once on\\r\\ntheir old familiar footing, as though the scene with Vladimir had never\\r\\noccurred. During the morning Irma said,{336} ‘When this terrible war is\\r\\nover, why don’t you exchange into the Russian service?’‘Why not? Alexis tells me we have many Englishmen and Scotsmen in our\\r\\narmy and navy. They have all risen to high commands. So would you; you\\r\\nare clever, you are brave, you are a gentleman. You say in your army you\\r\\ncan never hope to be an officer. Why not join ours? Alexis is your\\r\\nfriend, he has great influence, he would do anything for me. In a few\\r\\nyears you might be a colonel, a General. Who knows?’Jack’s position was getting awkward. He heartily wished himself back\\r\\namongst the mud and filth of Balaclava, amongst the wretchedness and\\r\\ndangers of the camp. Though this imperious young beauty could not be a\\r\\nday older than Jack, he felt like a baby in her hands.‘It would be impossible for me to do as you suggest,’ he said lamely.\\r\\n‘In the English army we join for a number of years, and I have yet ten\\r\\nto serve.’‘No matter,’ continued Irma with a merry laugh; ‘Alexis has plenty. Not\\r\\na word, it is settled. Now for my English lesson.’Next morning Irma and Jack were in the music-{337}room, when outside they\\r\\nheard a good deal of noise. They looked out of the window, and to their\\r\\nsurprise saw a party of Cossacks who had ridden in. Captain Kirchoff,\\r\\nthe officer in command, was talking to Sergius, who appeared to be\\r\\narguing with him, when the captain called to a trooper, who struck\\r\\nSergius with the butt-end of his lance, knocking him down. The officer\\r\\nthen spurred past, and, dismounting, entered the house.Irma’s face grew scarlet with passion, her aristocratic blood boiled.\\r\\n‘By my father’s soul!’ she cried, ‘the presumptuous dog shall learn he\\r\\ncannot lay a hand on a servant of our house on our domain. His shoulders\\r\\nshall feel the knout when Alexis hears of this!’‘Let us go and see what is amiss,’ said Jack quietly, who with a sinking\\r\\nheart guessed what had brought the Cossacks there.A servant came hurrying forward toward Jack and Irma. ‘An officer from\\r\\nSebastopol wishes to see the young excellency at once,’ he said, bowing.‘“His excellency” has no particular wish to see him,’ thought Jack to\\r\\nhimself; but he was going forward when Irma caught his arm.Loud voices were heard from below, and as they descended the stair Jack\\r\\nrecognised Captain Kirchoff’s voice. Though he did not know enough\\r\\nRussian to understand all that was said, he was able to distinguish the\\r\\nwords ‘Prisoner—Mentschikoff—peril—authority’—{338}—He found the countess, tall and dignified, confronting Kirchoff, who\\r\\nheld a paper in his hand. Behind Kirchoff were half-a-dozen Cossacks.‘Monsieur Blair,’ said the countess, ‘this officer, a most rude person,\\r\\nstates that he has orders to take you at once to Perekop.’‘But I refuse to allow it,’ said the countess. ‘My son would never have\\r\\nconsented to this step. I am told it is by Prince Mentschikoff’s orders;\\r\\nbut he would not go directly against the wishes of Alexis, who sends me\\r\\nno word.’‘Take no notice of this man,’ said Irma to Jack; ‘I will order him to go\\r\\nat once.’ And she spoke angrily to him in Russian.Kirchoff gave an ugly scowl; then said a few words to his men, and they\\r\\nimmediately advanced and seized Jack, who made no resistance.Irma, with a cry half of rage, half of fear, advanced to interfere\\r\\nbetween Jack and the soldiers; but Kirchoff, with a rude laugh, caught\\r\\nher by the wrists and held her despite her cries. Sergius, however, who\\r\\nhad evidently been watching the scene, sprang forward, and with one\\r\\nstrong, straight blow, felled Kirchoff to the ground. Other servants,\\r\\nall armed, appeared, and for a moment it seemed as if a fight must\\r\\nensue. Jack’s captors, however, closed around him, and with Irma’s cries\\r\\nstill ringing in his ears he was dragged away a prisoner, Kirchoff\\r\\nfollowing behind, cursing loudly and volubly.{339}The weather was very cold, and Kirchoff seemed in no hurry to leave his\\r\\ncomfortable quarters; but in the afternoon they went on again and\\r\\nreached Simpheropol. This was a most filthy place. The streets were\\r\\nknee-deep in mud and slush, and the few people they passed stared\\r\\napathetically at the Cossacks, who laid about them freely with their\\r\\nwhips.Jack was bundled into a disgustingly dirty lock-up, and the two men who\\r\\nconducted him no sooner got him inside than they stripped off his\\r\\nepaulets, rifled his pockets, and took every penny of money and\\r\\neverything of value he possessed. One of the men then struck savagely at\\r\\nJack’s head with the butt-end of his whip; but Jack, having had\\r\\nexperience of their treatment, was on the lookout, and, his arms being\\r\\nfree, he caught the fellow such a blow on the jaw that he retired,\\r\\nuttering threats of what he would do presently.Jack was then left alone, and, seating himself on a bundle of filthy\\r\\nstraw in one corner, he reviewed his situation, which seemed pretty\\r\\nhopeless. That Sominoff was at the bottom of the affair he felt{340}\\r\\nconvinced; but he could not understand how he had prevailed over the\\r\\ncount, who would, he felt assured, have done all he could for him.As it got dark, swarms of rats came out from innumerable holes, running\\r\\nover Jack’s feet and trying to claw up his legs. He had to walk about to\\r\\nkeep these noxious vermin off him. He had an instinctive dread of rats,\\r\\nand shouted aloud both to frighten them away and to call the attention\\r\\nof his captors. No notice, however, was taken of his cries, and in sheer\\r\\ndesperation he banged upon the door and tried to open it. To his intense\\r\\nsurprise it yielded and opened, and, stepping out, he found himself in\\r\\nthe passage. All was dark, and he went gently along, feeling his way\\r\\nwith his hands.Presently a gust of cold air blew upon his face, and he came to another\\r\\ndoor, which was also open. He stepped out into the moonlight just as\\r\\nseveral men threw themselves upon him. Filled with a horrible dread of\\r\\ngoing back to the noisome den he had just escaped from, Jack struggled\\r\\nfiercely, and the men seemed to release their hold of him as by common\\r\\nconsent.Then there was a dazzling flash in front of him, a loud report, and a\\r\\nball whizzed by him. It missed him by a hair’s-breadth; but a scream\\r\\nfrom behind told that some one had been hit.In an instant, several men with lanterns appeared upon the scene, just\\r\\nas Jack was again seized. Among the new-comers was Kirchoff and a\\r\\nCossack with a carbine in his hand. Just behind Jack was a Cossack lying\\r\\non the ground, and one of his comrades stooping over him pronounced him\\r\\ndead.‘Clumsy fool!’ cried Kirchoff furiously to the man{341} with the carbine,\\r\\n‘you have shot Ivan and the prisoner is unhurt.’Jack was dragged back to his prison, where he was punched, thumped,\\r\\nstruck with the butt-end of whips, and cruelly kicked, being left\\r\\ninsensible at last on the slimy, filthy floor. He revived presently to\\r\\nfind that swarms of rats were running over his hands and face, when,\\r\\naching in every limb and feeling ready to die, he crawled to the heap of\\r\\nstraw, and there, amidst the rats, vermin, and innumerable slimy,\\r\\ncreeping things, he passed the night.The following morning the journey was continued, and on the second night\\r\\nthey had reached Perekop which was if anything more dirty than\\r\\nSimpheropol. After their arrival Jack saw no more of Kirchoff and his\\r\\nCossacks, a party of Dragoons taking charge of him. From Perekop they\\r\\nwent on, marching leisurely, Jack being well treated. Near the Sea of\\r\\nAzov they passed the Putrid Sea, a stinking, sickening, dreadful place,\\r\\nthe very picture of desolation.For a week they proceeded through a cold, bleak, inhospitable country,\\r\\nlodging each night at prisons which varied only in their degrees of\\r\\nfilthiness. At last they arrived at Meritipol, and there Jack was lodged\\r\\nin prison, and saw no more of his escort of Dragoons. The days passed\\r\\ndrearily until at last a whole troop of French prisoners of war arrived.\\r\\nMany of them were confined in the same large apartment with Jack, and\\r\\nfrom them he was able to learn something of the state of affairs before\\r\\nSebastopol.The French soldiers had made the whole journey from Sebastopol on foot\\r\\nand were worn out with fatigue. Their boots were in shreds; many of\\r\\nthem{342} were sick and ill, and all of them were in a very despondent\\r\\nstate. When Jack spoke to them in their native language, and told them\\r\\nhe was an English prisoner of war, several of them embraced him and wept\\r\\ncopiously. Poor fellows, most of them were conscripts, and their hearts\\r\\nwere not in their profession. The prisoners mostly belonged to the 22nd\\r\\nof the line; but there were some Zouaves, who seemed of sterner mould,\\r\\nand two Chasseurs d’Afrique.These latter, when they found out Jack was one of the Light Brigade\\r\\nheroes, insisted upon kissing him on both cheeks and declaring\\r\\neverlasting friendship. One, who was a sous-officier, spoke English,\\r\\nand was very fond of airing his knowledge. Talking of the charge, he\\r\\ndeclared it was the finest thing the world had seen.‘But, mon ami,’ he said, ‘it was foolish—oh, so ver foolish; and if\\r\\nit had not been for the 4th Chasseurs d’Afrique, hélas! you poor\\r\\nEnglish—pouf, you would no more any of you remain alive.’From this man, whose name was Alphonse Bluet, Jack heard of the arrival\\r\\nof reinforcements, the progress of the siege, and the succession of\\r\\nPelissier the ‘Man of Iron’ to the command of the French. He also learnt\\r\\nthat the whole of the prisoners were on their way to some place farther\\r\\nnorth, where numbers of both French and English soldiers were already in\\r\\nconfinement.The French prisoners were in too exhausted a condition to march farther\\r\\nfor the present, so a long halt was made at Meritipol. Their treatment\\r\\nwas strict, but not rigorous, and about a fortnight passed away when\\r\\nthey were joined by a fresh batch of prisoners, and when they were\\r\\nbrought in Jack was{343} both pained and pleased to hear sturdy English\\r\\nvoices. The men were mostly fresh from England, belonging to the\\r\\ninfantry of the line, and with one or two sailors had been captured\\r\\nduring a Russian sortie.There was a marked difference in the demeanour of the French and\\r\\nEnglish. The latter were far more cheerful; and, though prisoners,\\r\\nplainly showed their guards they would stand no nonsense. They were\\r\\nconsequently treated with a great deal more consideration by the\\r\\nRussians, many of the latter showing a disposition to be quite friendly.One morning the prisoners were told that next day their march inland\\r\\nwould be resumed. Every man was served out with a pair of thick socks\\r\\nand rough boots and a sheepskin coat. Added to that was an overcoat with\\r\\na large yellow diamond on the back, and in the morning they started. The\\r\\nescort was of infantry, and their journey was to be on foot. The\\r\\nprisoners were informed they would be allowed thirty copecks[8] a day.\\r\\nOn this they were to provide for themselves.The weather was cold but fine, and in pretty good spirits the whole\\r\\nconvoy started. They had a long march that day, and in the afternoon\\r\\nentered a town. The drummer of the escort beat his drum as they marched\\r\\nin, and the inhabitants turned out to see the prisoners; but their\\r\\ndemeanour was not unfriendly. Under escort the prisoners were marched to\\r\\nthe market-place, where they made their purchases, after which they were\\r\\nconducted to the prison, where they cooked their food, often passing the\\r\\nevening quite merrily.{344}Ekaterinoslav was reached, and here two days’ halt was made; then on\\r\\nagain, day after day, week after week, through Kharkov and Starai-Oskoe,\\r\\nalways north, sometimes through pleasant country, sometimes through\\r\\nbleak and flat and wild regions.The French were not treated so well as the English, the Russians seeming\\r\\nfor some reason to dislike them personally. At Starai-Oskoe the French\\r\\nwere left behind, their destination being different from that of the\\r\\nEnglish.Alphonse Bluet parted with Jack most reluctantly, indulging freely in\\r\\ntears. ‘Farewell, mon ami!’ he cried; ‘I feel we shall never meet\\r\\nagain. The bones of Alphonse Bluet will whiten in this barbarous Russia;\\r\\nhe will never see the boulevards of his dear Paris again. But no matter.\\r\\nEver he will remember his brave comrade Monsieur Blair de Balaclava.’‘Cheer up, Alphonse,’ said Jack, ‘we shall meet again when we have\\r\\nlicked the Russians and peace is declared.’‘Licked? How do you mean? Je ne comprends pas.’ But a Russian sergeant\\r\\nat that moment, taking him by the nape of the neck, gently intimated\\r\\nthat it was time he joined his companions, and with a look of supreme\\r\\ndisdain at his captor and a wave of the hand to Jack, he was hurried\\r\\naway.There were still some weeks of tramping before Jack and his companions.\\r\\nAs they got farther north discipline was much relaxed, and they became\\r\\nquite friendly with their guards, especially when they stood treat to\\r\\nthem out of their thirty copecks, which they were easily able to do.At many of their halting-places the ladies of the town visited them,\\r\\ngiving them presents of warm{345} clothing, food, and so on. Several times\\r\\nthey came across English and Scotch people who had settled in Russia,\\r\\nand then they had a royal time.At last, at the end of what had been a really fine day, the captain of\\r\\nthe escort pointed to the burnished copper domes of a large town before\\r\\nthem, and said, ‘Men, that is Voronesh, the end of your journey.’He spoke in Russian, but by that time most of the men could understand\\r\\nwhat was said in that language, and Jack spoke it fairly well.Night had fallen ere they reached the town and were marched up to the\\r\\nmarket-place. They were then conducted to the different large buildings\\r\\nwhich served as prisons; and Jack, with about a dozen others, was taken\\r\\nto a stone building which had once served as a corn warehouse.Rather tired, he was making his way with the others to the large common\\r\\nliving-room when a familiar voice struck upon his ear.‘Ha, hum! it’s all very well to talk about the usages of civilised\\r\\nwarfare; but who is going to say these Russians are civilised? If they’d\\r\\nbeen going to exchange us, tell me why they shouldn’t have done it\\r\\nmonths ago? Why shouldn’t we have been kept in Sebastopol—eh, you\\r\\ntoads? Now tell me; I want to know?’Before any one had time to make an answer Jack had darted into the room,\\r\\nand, seizing both hands of the speaker, was crying, ‘Jimmy, dear old\\r\\nJimmy Linham, it was worth tramping all these hundreds of miles to find\\r\\nyou alive and well! We’ve mourned you as dead in the old regiment for\\r\\nmany and many a day.{346}’When Jack and his companions entered, an immediate hush fell upon the\\r\\ncompany; then a chorus of voices broke out, welcomes were uttered, those\\r\\nwho had been there some time shaking hands with the new-comers, assuring\\r\\nthem that life was not unbearable there, and saying they all had hopes\\r\\nof soon being exchanged. Then came questions about the operations of the\\r\\nwar. Had Sebastopol fallen? Had reinforcements and supplies come out?\\r\\nHow was the road from Balaclava? What was the old 47th or 23rd, or\\r\\nwhatever particular regiment the speaker belonged to, doing? And so on.‘Perhaps so, and there are several more cavalrymen here who went down in\\r\\nthe charge—Dryden of the 11th Hussars, who had thirty-six wounds when\\r\\nhe was found on the field by the Russians; Cooper of the 13th, who had\\r\\ntwenty-five; and Duke, same regiment, eighteen. We’ve several of the\\r\\n8th, three{347} of the 4th, and two 17th men, Stephenson and O’Lavery,\\r\\nbesides myself. But not one of these but what was most severely wounded.\\r\\nNearly a dozen of our fellows were taken from the field alive; but as\\r\\nfar as I’ve heard we three are the only survivors, except two officers,\\r\\nwho, I believe, were Cornets Leland and Sir William Lennox. While I was\\r\\nin hospital, a Russian who could speak English told me they had buried\\r\\nover forty men who had the “death’s head” on their appointments, and\\r\\nshowed me several buttons he had cut off their uniforms.’‘It was a terrible day, Jim,’ said Jack. ‘There were only thirty-four of\\r\\nus who came out of the charge. But tell me your own adventures?’‘They’re soon told. You remember, after you rallied the handful of ours\\r\\nand some of the 8th we charged? Well, I cut my way through that and the\\r\\nsecond lot, when you remember the Russian brutes opened on us and their\\r\\nown men from their field-guns.’‘Then it was that a piece of shell brought down my horse, and I was a\\r\\nbit stunned by the fall. Presently I freed myself, just as several\\r\\nPolish Lancers came at me. One I cut from his saddle, and was tackling\\r\\nthe others when another splinter of shell shattered my sword. One of the\\r\\nRussians then drew a pistol and shot at me, the ball passing through my\\r\\narm. A Dragoon came up and cut me over the head with his sword and I\\r\\nwent down; but before I lost consciousness some more Lancers went by and\\r\\ndug at me on the ground, piercing my left leg, my body, and my wounded\\r\\narm. I remembered no more till I was being carried off the field at\\r\\nnight, when I went in hospital with seven wounds. I had nothing to{348}\\r\\ncomplain of there, and in due course I was packed off with a batch of\\r\\nother prisoners and brought here. Now you know all about me. What of\\r\\nyourself, of the regiment, and all our comrades?’Of Inkermann, of the great hurricane, and something of the cruel\\r\\nsufferings of the badly clad, half-starved heroes dying by hundreds of\\r\\nexposure, overwork, cholera, and sheer starvation, Linham had already\\r\\nheard from the most recent batch of prisoners, and Jack told him how\\r\\nthings had been at the end of the year.‘What a Government, what bungling, what murder! Yet in spite of all, our\\r\\ngallant fellows never complain; they just work till they die, and the\\r\\nfew who survive will get a medal worth half-a-crown, and the right to\\r\\ndie in the workhouse—ha, hum!’Several other men then came in from another room, and amongst them were\\r\\nthose few survivors of the light cavalry charge whom Linham had spoken\\r\\nof.These few cavalrymen kept much together. Amongst them was the\\r\\ntrumpet-major of the 4th Light Dragoons, and an enormous trooper named\\r\\nParkes, standing six feet three. The trumpet-major of the 4th and Linham\\r\\nwere looked upon as the leaders of the little society, who all welcomed\\r\\nJack most heartily.Poor fellows! several of them were so disfigured and maimed by their\\r\\nwounds that their soldiering days were over for ever. With the exception\\r\\nof Linham, too, they were dressed in all sorts of nondescript rags—old\\r\\nsheepskin coats, Russian tunics, native wool trousers, and boots of\\r\\nevery description.{349} Here and there might be seen a tattered remnant of\\r\\nuniform, showing that, in spite of the long hair and great beards, the\\r\\nwearers had once been soldiers.Linham, however, still wore the remains of his uniform. How he had\\r\\nmanaged it was a mystery to all; but there he was, patched and darned\\r\\ntruly, but still in uniform, even to his stock, which he had refused to\\r\\nabandon when everybody else had thrown theirs away with joy. He had\\r\\nbought from a Russian a flat-topped, white-banded forage-cap, and was\\r\\nbrushed and pipe-clayed and shaved till he looked much like the Linham\\r\\nof old.The next day it was arranged that the new-comers should be entertained\\r\\nat a feast; and, as most of the men had a number of copecks saved out of\\r\\ntheir daily dole, provisions on a lavish scale were bought, and quite a\\r\\nmerry evening was spent, cards and dominoes, and after that songs and\\r\\nanecdotes, helping to pass the time pleasantly.On this occasion Linham so far unbent as to sing; in harsh, unmusical\\r\\ntones, the only song he was ever known to attempt:Jack found life at Voronesh tolerably comfortable. The governor of the\\r\\nplace was a kind-hearted man, and the prisoners were allowed much\\r\\nlatitude, being permitted to wander about the town almost at free-will.{350}There were several English families resident there, and some of the\\r\\nsoldiers had made friends with them, and were always welcome visitors.\\r\\nMany of the ladies of the town frequently came to the prison, bringing\\r\\npresents of clothes, food, wine, and such like.Altogether, the prisoners had nothing to complain of. There was no fear\\r\\nof any of them escaping; for, hundreds of miles from their comrades, in\\r\\na foreign country, without money or the means of transport, discovery\\r\\nand rearrest was absolutely certain, and that meant stricter captivity,\\r\\nwith hard and menial labour.Linham and the rest of the cavalrymen had made friends with a Scotsman\\r\\nwho managed a large oil-mill, and at his big hospitable house spent many\\r\\na comfortable hour. Jack was taken there, and soon became a favourite,\\r\\nespecially with the mistress of the house and the two daughters.Weeks passed, spring and summer came, and Jack found himself still a\\r\\nprisoner. He was sick of his inactive life and longed to be back again\\r\\nwith his regiment. Of what was going on the prisoners knew nothing; the\\r\\nonly bit of news they had received was that Czar Nicholas was dead.Although the prisoners were always inquiring, no news of any exchange\\r\\never came, and it almost seemed as if in that, to them, out-of-the-way\\r\\ncorner of the world they had been forgotten by friends and foes alike.Jack and Linham were returning one evening from the house of the\\r\\nScotsman to their prison, where they had to be by sunset to answer to\\r\\ntheir names, when Jack saw a trading caravan enter the place. They were\\r\\non their way to Moscow, having come from{351} Perekop, and it was stated\\r\\nthat they would remain in the town a few days, holding a sort of market.The arrival of the caravan caused quite a sensation in the town, and the\\r\\nprisoners promised themselves to go down next morning and see what was\\r\\noffered for sale, more from curiosity than anything else, as they had no\\r\\nmoney to buy with.Jack and Linham were wandering about next morning, examining the various\\r\\narticles, when Jack noticed a stout-looking man who seemed to be eyeing\\r\\nthem very keenly.Presently the Russian took a pair of boots from a wagon near him,\\r\\nstepped up to Jack and said in low tones, in Russian, which Jack could\\r\\nthen speak fairly well, ‘Don’t you know me, excellency?’The man looked straight at him, and his eyes and nose seemed familiar;\\r\\nbut that beard and long hair—no. But stay. Was it—could it be—— And\\r\\nJack paused; then said, ‘You’re not Sergius surely?’‘Yes, excellency, I am he. I am here to help you to escape. My lord the\\r\\ncount wills it. Pretend to bargain for the boots, for we may be\\r\\nwatched.’Jack did so, and Sergius continued, ‘I have been months trying to find\\r\\nyou. I have been to four other places. I have horses and a disguise. You\\r\\nmust slip away; arrange to meet me, and when it is dark we will fly.’Jack was wild with delight for a few minutes, and entered fully into the\\r\\nscheme, then he thought of his companions, and of Linham especially. He\\r\\nwould not go and leave his old comrade behind. He told Sergius so.‘Excellency,’ urged Sergius, ‘we cannot talk longer now; come back\\r\\nto-morrow and arrange. We start in two days; then you must come.’‘But I will not go without you,’ said Jack; ‘we have gone through too\\r\\nmuch together for me to desert you now.’Then in more husky tones he said, ‘Jack, you’ll go. I’m an old war-horse\\r\\nthat it doesn’t matter a snap about. I don’t say much, but the wound in\\r\\nmy leg troubles me a great deal. I fear I shall never do much more\\r\\nsoldiering. Go and leave me.’‘But you must. What’s the good of you’re staying here? You can’t do us\\r\\nany good. You’ve got all your life before you, so what’s the good of\\r\\nbeing silly, now, I want to know?’That night the little cavalry clique gathered together in one corner of\\r\\nthe general room, and Linham solemnly put to them the facts of the case.Next morning Jack again sought Sergius, and fought a big fight with him.\\r\\nIn the end he agreed{353} to include Linham in the party, though he said it\\r\\nwould increase the risk of detection.Then Linham was obstinate and refused to go till Jack declared he would\\r\\nnot go without him, and so at last it was decided.The secret was told to most of the prisoners, who immediately set about\\r\\nwriting letters to relatives and friends, which Jack and Linham were to\\r\\ntake with them. Final arrangements were made with Sergius, and on the\\r\\nfourth day Jack and Linham were to make their attempt.They had a sort of farewell supper, and all sorts of messages were given\\r\\nto the two Lancers for friends and comrades in camp should they ever\\r\\nreach it.Next morning, with a number of others, they left the prison as usual,\\r\\ntheir hearts beating wildly, for if all went well by that time to-morrow\\r\\nthey hoped to be many miles away.The caravan was to start about midday, and bartering had been finished.\\r\\nSergius had a van driven by a lad and a droshky in which he himself\\r\\ntravelled.Jack and Linham with their friends went down to the arch under which\\r\\nSergius’s van and droshky were kept at night, and they stood round\\r\\ntalking and watching Sergius stow away his wares for the journey. They\\r\\nwere at the back of the wagon, with the other prisoners all round them.\\r\\nWaiting until Sergius made them a sign that there was no one about, Jack\\r\\nand Linham popped into the wagon, were promptly hidden between two\\r\\nbales, and covered with a pile of rugs.It seemed a very long time to them before they started; but presently,\\r\\nwith a rumble, off they went,{354} and as the wheels rolled from the stones\\r\\nto the more even metalled road a cheer burst forth.‘That’s a signal from those friends who have followed us that we are\\r\\nsafely out of the town,’ said Jack.‘If the chaps can only answer our names for us to-night, as they said\\r\\nthey would try to do,’ said Jack, ‘that will give us a good start,\\r\\nproviding our absence is not discovered until to-morrow.’‘They will do all they can,’ said Linham; and, lulled by the motion of\\r\\nthe wagon, both he and Jack fell asleep.They found they were in the open country, far away from Voronesh. The\\r\\ndroshky stood behind them, and the driver was feeding his horses.‘I dropped behind,’ said Sergius; ‘the others are now well ahead. We\\r\\nmust do quickly what we have to do,’ and he produced a bundle containing\\r\\ncomplete suits of clothes, which he wanted Jack and Linham to assume.\\r\\nJack at once consented, but Linham flatly refused.He would wear no Russian clothes he said. If he were captured it should\\r\\nbe as a soldier; he would run no risk of being shot as a spy. In the end\\r\\nhe consented to wear a black astrakhan cap, and put on{355} a light coat\\r\\nover his uniform, which quite altered his appearance.Jack assumed the dress of a Russian trader; then, transferring several\\r\\npackages from the van to the droshky, Sergius bade Jack and Linham\\r\\nenter, and whipping up his horses, away they went southwards.‘My boy will overtake the others, and travel with them as far as Moscow.\\r\\nThere he will sell all and return to Teberti.’The two horses in the droshky were splendid animals and spanked along at\\r\\na grand rate. By nightfall they had travelled fifty versts, and they\\r\\nslept at a tiny village where no questions were asked.Next day they went on again, and thanks to the passport with which the\\r\\ncount had provided Sergius, and thanks also to a good supply of money\\r\\nwhich he used freely, they made splendid progress.They went by unfrequented roads, staying mostly at small villages.\\r\\nJack’s knowledge of Russian stood them in good stead; and though, owing\\r\\nto Linham’s eccentricities, they had several narrow escapes from\\r\\ndetection by detachments of soldiers they met upon the road, at last\\r\\nthey crossed the Dneiper at Kherson, and next day came once again in\\r\\nsight of Perekop, which town, however, Sergius avoided, going on as far\\r\\nas Balgaza.Jack was overjoyed at finding himself once more in the Crimea, and hoped\\r\\nsoon to be again with the British army. The following night they neared\\r\\nSimpheropol, and then it was necessary to move with the greatest\\r\\ncaution, as they were surrounded by Russian troops. They were not very\\r\\nfar from Old Fort, the spot where the allied armies had landed{356} nearly a\\r\\nyear before, and Jack sighed as he thought of the terrible experiences\\r\\nthey had passed through since that date.At a small village just north of Baktschi-Serai, Sergius placed Jack and\\r\\nLinham in the house of a small farmer, and bade them on no account show\\r\\nthemselves till he returned. That was not until the following night,\\r\\nwhen he was accompanied by another rider.Jack saw them dismount, and in a few moments the taller figure had\\r\\nentered the house, and, running up to Jack, had taken him by both hands.\\r\\nIt was Count Pauloff, and his joy at seeing Jack was undeniable.‘My dear friend,’ he said, ‘I cannot tell you how much I rejoice to see\\r\\nyou again. After I left you at Teberti I went straight to Sebastopol.\\r\\nLiprandi had returned, and with him I sought out the Prince and begged\\r\\nfor your release. I found, however, that my cousin Sominoff had\\r\\nforestalled me, had procured an order for you to be conveyed to Perekop,\\r\\nand had sent an escort to conduct you. I had passed the escort on my way\\r\\nto Sebastopol. The Prince had, however, insisted that you should be well\\r\\ntreated. Determined not to be defeated, directly I could obtain leave to\\r\\ngo to Teberti I sent Sergius to seek you, and here you are.’‘No thanks, friend. I am still in your debt, for you saved my life; I\\r\\nhave only procured your liberty. I have the order for your release in my\\r\\npocket, for, alas! poor Vladimir can no longer oppose me in this; he was\\r\\nkilled a month ago in the streets of Sebastopol by the splinter of a\\r\\nshell from the French batteries.{357} But who is this?’ pointing to Linham,\\r\\nwho had discarded his Russian coat and stood revealed in the remains of\\r\\nhis uniform.Jack explained, and the count laughed. ‘I can manage it,’ he said. ‘I\\r\\nhave horses. To-morrow morning we will start, and I will see you through\\r\\nour lines. By midday you will be among your own people. Now you must\\r\\nreturn with me and see my mother and Irma.’This, however, Jack was by no means willing to do. He had a very great\\r\\nrespect for the beautiful but imperious girl, but he did not want to\\r\\nmeet her in her mother’s house again. He fancied she might renew her\\r\\npersuasion that he should transfer to the Russian army, and somehow—he\\r\\nhardly liked to confess it to himself—she exercised more will-power\\r\\nover him than he cared to own. So he pleaded fatigue, and they passed\\r\\nthe night at the farm.Next morning, Jack mounted on a splendid horse the count had brought,\\r\\nand Linham on Sergius’s mount, they started, and in glorious weather\\r\\nrode on, crossing the Katcha and the Belbec, skirting the Russian\\r\\ndivision in the Korales Valley, and eventually reaching the Tractir\\r\\nBridge.Here the count halted. ‘It will not be safe for me to go farther,’ he\\r\\nsaid, ‘or I may find you and I have changed places.’‘And I fear I should have much more difficulty in procuring your release\\r\\nthan you did mine,’ said Jack.With mutual good wishes, Jack sending very kind messages to the countess\\r\\nand Irma, he shook hands with the count, and Linham saluted. They\\r\\ndismounted, and were going to cross the bridge on foot; but the count\\r\\nstayed them.{358}‘I want you both to accept the horses you ride,’ he said, ‘as a present\\r\\nto two gallant soldiers whom I only regret having met as enemies instead\\r\\nof as comrades.’Jack was really touched at this new proof of kindness, and when they had\\r\\nparted he sat for some time watching the figure of the gallant count as\\r\\nhe trotted away.He and Linham then crossed the bridge and soon met an English picket,\\r\\nwho stared in open-eyed astonishment at the nondescript pair. The\\r\\nsoldiers were healthy, well-fed, rosy-looking English lads in smart\\r\\nscarlet tunics, wearing good boots, their appointments being bright and\\r\\nclean. The sergeant, who had come from England but a few months ago, and\\r\\nknew of the winter misery only by hearsay, heard with astonishment that\\r\\nthe two before them were English prisoners of war. They were taken to\\r\\nthe officer commanding the picket, who was equally astonished, but who,\\r\\nat their request, passed them on to the cavalry camp.Presently they saw the rows of tents and the horse lines. Then\\r\\nlance-flags were seen fluttering, and a party of Lancers passed them.\\r\\nJack and Linham stared in astonishment. All the men were smart, clean,\\r\\nand well clothed and booted. Even their uniforms were changed; the\\r\\ntunics had a white, turned-back facing.Jack and Linham stood humbly by their horses, while a little crowd of\\r\\nmen, all of the 17th, but all strangers from England, gathered round\\r\\nthem, staring curiously at the two travel-stained and battered arrivals.A big man came shouldering his way through the gazers, an officer\\r\\nfollowed him, and the troopers sprang to attention.‘Here’s a couple of chaps who say they belong to “ours,”’ said the\\r\\nsentry; ‘but strikes me they’re frauds. They look more like rag-pickers\\r\\nthan Lancers.’‘Heavens above!’ cried Barrymore in mighty tones. ‘Stand back there,\\r\\nmen!—Jack, Jim, God bless you both! we’d given you up as dead months\\r\\nago!’The officer approached. It was Leland, no longer cornet, but captain. He\\r\\nstared a moment; then took the hands of the nondescripts as Barrymore\\r\\nhad done.‘Who are they?’ roared Barrymore. ‘Why, men who covered themselves with\\r\\nglory while you were learning your drill at Canterbury. They’re Sergeant\\r\\nLinham and “Blair of Balaclava.”’‘Blair of Balaclava?’ cried the men, and then spontaneously there burst\\r\\nout a cheer, and in a{360} moment the two heroes were seized, seated\\r\\nshoulder high, and, amidst the thundering plaudits of men who had heard\\r\\nof their deeds over and over again, despite their struggles they were\\r\\ncarried to the headquarters of the regiment whose recent laurels they\\r\\nhad borne no mean share in winning.Barrymore, saluting, told the colonel who they were escorting, and in\\r\\nanother moment Colonel Norreys was wringing Jack’s hand.‘My dear Blair,’ he said, ‘it is to you and Barrymore that I owe my\\r\\nlife. I ought to have died if any man ought on that fatal day; how I\\r\\nmanaged to cheat the doctors I don’t know. Your conduct in the affair\\r\\nwas reported with Barrymore’s; but we all feared you had been killed.’‘You must tell me all your adventures; but first I must introduce you to\\r\\nthe other officers, nearly all, alas! strangers to you, but all of whom\\r\\nhave heard of your exploits.’The colonel then turned to Linham. ‘Welcome back to you, too, sergeant,’\\r\\nhe said; ‘it will seem something like old times to see your familiar\\r\\nfeatures in the ranks again.’Jack did his best to get away from the congratulations and flattering\\r\\nspeeches of his officers, most of{362} whom, as the colonel had said, were\\r\\nnew to the regiment, consequently strangers. Hardly had he succeeded\\r\\nbefore his hand was clutched in a firm grasp, and turning, he saw—could\\r\\nhe believe his eyes?—Will Hodson, staring at him with an eye\\r\\nsuspiciously dim.‘Thanks to you, dear old chap, I’m alive. I was almost done when I got\\r\\naboard at Balaclava; but the warmth and comfort did me good. I went back\\r\\nagain after getting to Scutari. Oh the horrors of that place, Jack!\\r\\nNothing that we heard about it came up to the reality. But there was an\\r\\nangel just arrived there, Miss Nightingale, from England. She was\\r\\nbeginning to get the place into some sort of order, and I was lucky in\\r\\ncoming under her notice. Two months it was before I was able to get back\\r\\nto duty; but I never should at all had it not been for her.’Jack and Linham were taken possession of by Barrymore and those men who\\r\\nhad been in the charge, and were the lions of the hour. They were soon\\r\\nassigned quarters, new uniforms were served out to them, and they\\r\\nresumed their regimental duties.They found a tremendous difference in the camp. Large drafts had come\\r\\nout for the regiments that had served through the war, and many\\r\\nregiments had arrived to whom Alma, Balaclava, and Inkermann were but\\r\\nnames. The cavalry had received such large drafts that they were almost\\r\\nnew regiments. Huts had sprung up, and the men had more clothing than\\r\\nthey knew what to do with.{363}In June, fur coats, blankets, and woollen caps had arrived in thousands.\\r\\nThe uniforms of the new arrivals were clean and smart, the men again\\r\\nlooked more like soldiers than navvies, hundreds of remounts had been\\r\\nprocured. The 10th Hussars and 12th Lancers had arrived from India and\\r\\nthe Carbineers from England. There was an abundance of good food, an\\r\\nalmost unlimited supply of war material, the hospital arrangements had\\r\\nbeen vastly improved, the health of the whole army was very good; and\\r\\nlastly, and most wonderful of all, a railway had been constructed\\r\\nbetween Balaclava and the camp!These things were so amazing that it took Jack and Linham some days to\\r\\nbelieve it all. They heard about the assault of the Malakoff, and the\\r\\ndetermined, but unfortunate attack on the Redan in June. This was sad\\r\\nnews; but sadder still was the news of the death of the gallant, the\\r\\nkindly, the warm-hearted Lord Raglan.Bitterly mortified at the attempt of the Government to make him a\\r\\nscapegoat for their own gross mismanagement, he had worried in secret.\\r\\nThe failure of the attack on the Redan and the death of a very dear\\r\\nfriend and brother-officer, working on a constitution already weakened\\r\\nby the tremendous strain of the war, had caused an illness of which he\\r\\ndied calmly and quietly on June 29th.The honour paid to his remains on their removal to the vessel which was\\r\\nto convey them to England spoke of the esteem in which he was held by\\r\\nthe army. English, French, Sardinians, even the Russians themselves,\\r\\npaid the highest respect to his memory.Sergeant Linham seemed very depressed after his return to the regiment.\\r\\n‘Here we are, Jack,’ he said,{364} ‘stuck just in the same place; only it’s\\r\\nall so different. The officers are different, the men different, even\\r\\nour very uniform’s different, and what’s the use of it all, ha, hum! I\\r\\nwant to know?’Jack tried to cheer him up; but it was clear the sergeant was fretting,\\r\\nand it was evidently over the loss of his old comrades. There was,\\r\\nbesides, another cause that made him downhearted that Jack did not know\\r\\nof till later—his wounded leg was causing him great pain and\\r\\ninconvenience.About the middle of August spies brought in word that the Russians were\\r\\ngoing to make a great effort to raise the siege, and consequently the\\r\\nAllies were kept on the alert.Jack’s squadron was moved down to Balaclava, close to the newly arrived\\r\\nSardinian contingent, being brigaded under Jack’s old colonel, who had\\r\\nreturned from England, having quite recovered.Every morning at an hour before daybreak they paraded, and on the 16th,\\r\\nsoon after they assembled, the sound of heavy firing on their front\\r\\nshowed them that the Russians were attacking. The firing got heavier,\\r\\nand as day began to dawn the English cavalry were moved off down the\\r\\nvery valley along which they had made their famous charge.Presently the cavalry came in sight of the Tractir Bridge, which was\\r\\nbeing held by French infantry. These were attacked by huge masses of\\r\\nRussian infantry and artillery, and were driven back, but rallying, they\\r\\nretook the bridge at the point of the{365} bayonet. The Russians again\\r\\nrouted them; but with indomitable gallantry the French once more\\r\\nattacked and drove the Russians across the river.But the Russians were in overwhelming numbers, and for the second time\\r\\nthey took the bridge and the heights above it, and began to advance on\\r\\nBalaclava itself.Things were looking serious, and the gallant Scarlett, now commanding\\r\\nthe English cavalry, prepared his brigade for action. The Russians had\\r\\nquite sixty squadrons, and it was confidently expected that the cavalry\\r\\nwould be heavily engaged. Seeing the enemy’s cavalry advancing from\\r\\nTchorgoun towards the river, Scarlett moved his glittering squadrons\\r\\nforward.Jack’s squadron was on the right, and the men tightened their hold on\\r\\ntheir bridles and gripped their lances, expecting every moment to be\\r\\ncharging the enemy. In this they were, however, disappointed, being\\r\\nretreated behind a Sardinian outpost. Rising ground hid them from the\\r\\nRussian cavalry, and presently General de la Marmora, the Sardinian\\r\\ncommander-in-chief, with his gay staff, cantered along between the\\r\\nEnglish and the Sardinians, as though making for the plain beyond the\\r\\nrising ground.General Scarlett was talking to Colonel Norreys when suddenly several\\r\\nsquadrons of Russian Hussars were seen to have swept round on the right\\r\\nflank behind some hills, and were driving in at a gallop between the\\r\\nEnglish cavalry and the Sardinian staff. The danger of the Sardinians\\r\\nwas seen at once, and General Scarlett, in a few brief words to Colonel{366}\\r\\nNorreys, bade him charge. The squadron sprang forward, the charge rang\\r\\nout, and the Lancers were racing at top speed, so as to get between the\\r\\nRussians and the Sardinian staff.The Russian Hussars seeing the Lancers coming brought up their right\\r\\nshoulders so as to face the oncoming horsemen; then once again showed\\r\\nthe curious hesitancy which seemed natural to them. With a crash the\\r\\nLancers met them, riding them down and scattering them like chaff.Jack drove his lance right through the body of a Hussar, and lost it. In\\r\\nan instant he had his sword in his hand and was aiming a blow at an\\r\\nofficer dressed in a magnificent white uniform, when, glancing at his\\r\\nfeatures, he recognised Count Pauloff. With a cry he withdrew his arm\\r\\nand swept by. Next minute the Russians were in full retreat, the count\\r\\nunhurt among them. Half-an-hour afterwards the battle was over, the\\r\\nRussians defeated, and the French and Sardinians in pursuit.The Russians lost between five and six thousand men, and they realised\\r\\nonce and for all that though they might be in overwhelming numbers they\\r\\nwere no match for the Allies in the open field.{367}Jack had been away with his troop for some time in the valley of the\\r\\nBaidar; and, returning to camp late one afternoon, as he rode in was met\\r\\nby Will, who, after asking him what had happened, said, ‘While you’ve\\r\\nbeen away there’s been a staff-officer over here several times asking\\r\\nfor you. He seemed most anxious to see you.’‘That I don’t know, though I’ve seen him once or twice with the staff.\\r\\nAnyway, he left a letter to be given to you. Here it is.’‘Dear Sir,—I should much like to see you, having heard a deal of\\r\\nyour conspicuous gallantry in the memorable cavalry charge of Oct.\\r\\n25th last.‘More especially I want to thank you for saving my life at the\\r\\npassage of the Alma, and for carrying the despatch of which I was\\r\\nthe bearer, and which bore largely on the success of that day.‘I am also most anxious to ask you a few questions{368} about your\\r\\nfamily, for it may even turn out that we may be related.—Yours\\r\\nsincerely,‘Good Heavens! Colonel Harrington.’ It must be his mother’s younger\\r\\nbrother, his own uncle Charles, of whom he had often heard but never\\r\\nseen. He remembered him at the Alma quite well; and, yes, there was a\\r\\nstrong family likeness between his mother and the colonel. It was too\\r\\nlate to go to headquarters that night, but he would take the first\\r\\nopportunity he had and seek out this new-found uncle.The next morning a terrific bombardment was opened on Sebastopol, and it\\r\\nsoon became evident that an assault was to be made that day. Companies\\r\\nof infantry were being marched to the trenches, supports were hurried\\r\\nup, ambulance-men followed, and all knew a great struggle was about to\\r\\ncommence.Jack obtained permission to go up to headquarters; but when he got there\\r\\nhe found the colonel had gone down to the trenches with Sir William\\r\\nCodrington. Thither Jack followed him, making his way to the fifth\\r\\nparallel, in which was the General.All around him were men crouching, having ladders with which to scale\\r\\nthe walls. Jack looked in vain for Colonel Harrington; he was nowhere to\\r\\nbe seen. The excitement of the coming assault had, however, seized Jack,\\r\\nand for the moment he forgot the cause which had brought him there.Troops continued to arrive, and it was known the Redan was the point of\\r\\nattack, while the French were again to attempt the Malakoff. At noon the\\r\\nbombardment was urged to a terrific blaze of fire,{369} which poured from\\r\\nmany embrasures until then kept closed.Soon after twelve the signal for the French to storm was given by the\\r\\nexplosion of two mines near the counterscarp, and in the confusion\\r\\ncaused by the smoke and uproar, the Zouaves and Chasseurs rushed over\\r\\nthe twenty-five yards dividing the ditch of the Malakoff from their own\\r\\nparallel, and taking the Russians completely by surprise, drove them out\\r\\nof the redoubt at the point of the bayonet. The tricolour was soon\\r\\nflying over the Malakoff. That was the signal for the English to attack\\r\\nthe Redan.The Russians opened a heavy fire of grape upon the trenches, doing much\\r\\ndamage as the men clambered over the parapet. They had then to pass\\r\\nthrough a murderous fire of round-shot, grape, and musketry, and they\\r\\nfell in scores. Wildly dashing through, they charged over the three\\r\\nhundred yards that separated them from the Redan, into the ditch of\\r\\nwhich they scrambled. Men of different regiments became inextricably\\r\\nmixed. A dense mass were jammed on the salient of the Redan. They opened\\r\\na heavy fire over the parapet upon the enemy in the interior of the\\r\\nwork, though losing heavily from rifle and artillery fire the while.Fresh troops continued to arrive, but there was no room on which to\\r\\ncollect for a sudden rush into the Redan. Ammunition was constantly\\r\\npassed up and a continuous fire upon the interior was maintained.\\r\\nHundreds fell on both sides, the ditch being actually covered with dead.\\r\\nAt last the supply of ammunition gave out, perceiving which the enemy\\r\\nmade a sudden rush upon the salient, and by sheer weight caused the\\r\\nattackers to fall back into the ditch on to{370} the tops of bayonets,\\r\\nladders, and poor wounded men who writhed in agony as they were crushed\\r\\nto death. Then the Russians stood upon the parapet and threw hand\\r\\ngrenades, stones, and every conceivable missile upon the struggling mass\\r\\nbelow them.An hour had passed, and the English had not yet captured the Redan.\\r\\nThen, after a heroic struggle, the survivors were being driven back for\\r\\nlack of supports. A fresh body of red-coats, men of the Buffs, and 41st,\\r\\n90th, and 97th, made a rush forward, gallantly led by staff-officers.\\r\\nThey came close by Jack just as a bullet struck the cocked hat from the\\r\\nhead of one of the leaders. In an instant Jack had recognised him; it\\r\\nwas Colonel Harrington, his uncle!A young midshipman, badly wounded, lay close by Jack, his naked sword by\\r\\nhis side. Fired by a sudden impulse, Jack snatched up the sword and\\r\\nrushed forward with the stormers. In an instant he was in a regular\\r\\nstorm of grape and bullets, and men were falling quickly all round him.\\r\\nHe made his way along, and was soon with the men who had been driven\\r\\nfrom the Redan.These, men of all regiments, inextricably mixed, were firing steadily\\r\\nupon the Russians, holding their ground and waiting, waiting for the\\r\\nsupports—supports which never came. Yet they hung on, losing men by\\r\\ntens and dozens.Officers went back to try and get reinforcements; but General Codrington\\r\\nhesitated. Then the Royals sprang forward, and made a last attempt; but\\r\\ntheir formation was lost, and they were soon mixed up with the bleeding,\\r\\npanting, and exhausted crowd.The guns from the Barrack and Garden Batteries{371} poured in grape, and the\\r\\nRussians, issuing from the Redan, rushed on with the bayonet. A struggle\\r\\nthat almost baffles description took place, and the British were borne\\r\\nback.Jack fought his way close to Colonel Harrington, who was attempting to\\r\\nget the regimental officers to rally their men. A number of Russians\\r\\ncame charging forward, and an officer cut at Colonel Harrington, but\\r\\nJack with the pistol of a dead officer shot the Russian. Then a terrible\\r\\nmêlée took place, and the English began to retire rapidly towards their\\r\\ntrenches, pursued by a perfect storm of lead.Keeping in the rear, Jack presently missed Colonel Harrington, and,\\r\\nlooking round, saw him lying on the ground some distance in the rear.\\r\\nHeedless of the storm of bullets, he ran back and raised the colonel’s\\r\\nhead, attempting to get him on his feet. He succeeded, when two Russian\\r\\nsharpshooters rushed forward.One Jack cut down; but the other wounded the colonel in the leg with his\\r\\nbayonet, only next instant to fall dead, shot through the head. The\\r\\ncolonel was on the ground, and Jack attempted to carry him; but he was\\r\\ntoo heavy.A sergeant of the Fusiliers, though, seeing what was happening, ran\\r\\nback, and, helping Jack, they together raised the colonel and carried\\r\\nhim along with the retiring troops. They had almost reached the most\\r\\nadvanced parallel when the gallant sergeant was cut almost in two by a\\r\\nround-shot. Other willing hands, however, now helped, and the colonel\\r\\nwas got into the trenches. There a stretcher was procured,{372} Jack bearing\\r\\none end, and the colonel was got out of danger to the hospital tent.Jack remained with him while the surgeon bound up his wounded leg and\\r\\nhis left arm, which had also been struck by a bullet. He had never lost\\r\\nconsciousness during the whole time, and when his wounds were dressed he\\r\\nsaid to Jack, ‘My brave fellow, I see you belong to the Lancers. What\\r\\nare you doing here?’The colonel looked at him. ‘Is it?’ he said faintly. ‘Are you the\\r\\ntrumpeter whom I met first at the Alma? But I see you are. Tell me, who\\r\\nwas your father?’‘After Balaclava,’ he said, ‘I heard several times about you from\\r\\nCaptain Norreys. Quite by accident I saw your name some months later\\r\\nreturned amongst the missing as John Harrington Blair. I remembered\\r\\nhearing that my sister’s son had received her maiden name, and a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth dawned upon me. I determined to see you, but you\\r\\nwere supposed to be dead. Only the other day I heard you had returned\\r\\nfrom captivity, and I rode over to your camp and left a note for you.\\r\\nNow we meet thus!’They talked some time longer, and then Jack helped to take the colonel\\r\\nto his own tent, where he was made comfortable and put under the care of\\r\\nhis servant, a thoroughly reliable old soldier.Jack then said he must return to his regiment, and the colonel took his\\r\\nhand. ‘My dear boy,’ he said, ‘it gives me very genuine pleasure to have\\r\\nfound you, and that you are so much like my sister is an additional\\r\\nreason for liking you. I hope soon to be about{373} again, and then I shall\\r\\nmake it my business to push your promotion.’Jack thanked his uncle for his good wishes; but he was more pleased over\\r\\nthe joy he knew it would give his mother to be again on friendly terms\\r\\nwith her family than he was at the promise of the colonel’s influence on\\r\\nhis behalf.{374}Had Jack received an electric shock he could not have leapt up quicker.\\r\\nIn two minutes he was outside and hurrying off with Barrymore and Will\\r\\nto a place whence they could get a good view.There they saw dense clouds of black smoke rising from the town, while\\r\\nfrequent violent explosions rent the air. The Russians had retreated\\r\\nacross their bridge to the north side about two o’clock in the morning,\\r\\nhaving previously set fire to the town. The Malakoff was the key to the\\r\\nenemy’s position, and the loss of it compelled the Russians to evacuate\\r\\nthe town. The attack upon the Redan, though unsuccessful, had drawn off\\r\\na large force from the Malakoff, and thus rendered the task of the\\r\\nFrench much easier.As the news flew round the camp that the siege of Sebastopol, the\\r\\nlongest in modern history, was over, tremendous cheers burst out. The\\r\\nmost curious thing about it all to Jack was the cessation from the\\r\\nincessant crashing of guns. Not a single cannon boomed. Pickets were at\\r\\nonce sent out to prevent any one from entering Sebastopol, and a general\\r\\norder was issued thanking all ranks for their efforts to take the town.{375}That day poor Linham, who for some days had been very morose, confided\\r\\nto Jack that the wound in his leg so troubled him that he could no\\r\\nlonger keep to his duty. Since the battle of the Tchernaya it had broken\\r\\nout afresh, and had been getting gradually worse. Jack and Will at once\\r\\ntook him to the regimental doctor, who shook his head when he examined\\r\\nthe wound.‘Bad, bad—very bad,’ he said. ‘This ought to have been seen to long\\r\\nago. Besides, you are much run down. A steamer starts from Balaclava\\r\\nto-morrow with invalids for England. I will get you sent with them. You\\r\\nhave done your work here, and the sea voyage and good treatment at home\\r\\nwill put you right.’Sergeant Linham at first resolutely refused to go; but the colonel\\r\\nbacked up the order, and Jack and Will took him down to Balaclava and\\r\\nsaw him aboard the Himalaya.‘Ha, hum! good-bye, boys,’ said Linham as they parted on the deck.\\r\\n‘Somehow I feel my soldiering days are done. The war must be pretty near\\r\\nover now, and when the regiment comes home mind you come and see me if I\\r\\nam still in hospital.’Jack and Will promised, and shook hands with their old comrade, who in a\\r\\nstrangely husky voice said, ‘God bless you, you toads!’The next day Jack was one of the commander-in-chief’s escort when he\\r\\nrode through Sebastopol, and Jack gazed in wonder at the awful ruins.\\r\\nThe houses were roofless and gutted, every inch of ground was ploughed\\r\\nup by shot and shell, and dead and dying Russians lay about on every\\r\\nhand. Life in Sebastopol must have been almost unbearable. The ditch of\\r\\nthe{376} Redan was still half-full of the brave fellows who had fallen in\\r\\nthe attack, and Jack gazed at them sadly, thinking that if Sebastopol\\r\\nwas at last theirs bitter had been the price paid for it.[9]Exactly twelve days after the fall of Sebastopol, on the first\\r\\nanniversary of the battle of the Alma, a review was held, and the\\r\\nCrimean medals just sent out from England were distributed. The medals\\r\\nhad no names on them; but some sort of a muddle had been expected.Jack’s medal had four clasps, and at the presentation it was further\\r\\nannounced that for the gallant charge made by a squadron of the regiment\\r\\nat the battle of the Tchernaya, by which General de la Marmora and his\\r\\nstaff had been saved from capture, the General had intimated that all\\r\\nthe officers and non-commissioned officers of that squadron, excluding\\r\\ncorporals, would be presented with the Sardinian war-medal, and that six\\r\\ntroopers or corporals, to be elected by their comrades, would be\\r\\nsimilarly decorated.‘That means that we shall have two medals instead of one,’ said Jack to\\r\\nWill, who had fortunately been with the squadron.Jack had several times been to visit his new-found uncle, Colonel\\r\\nHarrington; who, though making progress, was still very ill, and the\\r\\ndoctors had ordered him at once to return to England. Jack went down to\\r\\nBalaclava with him, and the colonel’s last{377} words were, ‘When I get\\r\\nhome, and am well enough, the first visit I shall make will be to your\\r\\nmother and your sisters. From what you have told me of the girls I am\\r\\nmost anxious to see them. And as for you, dear Jack, take care of\\r\\nyourself, and mind and write to me. I shall use my influence for you at\\r\\nthe Horse Guards, for if you intend to remain in the army I shall see\\r\\nthat you serve as an officer, a position for which you have every\\r\\nqualification.’Jack thanked his uncle cordially, and begged he would convey his love to\\r\\nall his relatives and friends. Riding back from Balaclava, having plenty\\r\\nof time, he dismounted and walked for a considerable distance along the\\r\\nfatal valley down which they had made their charge, looking about him at\\r\\nthe Causeway Heights and the Fedoukine Hills, the different landmarks\\r\\nbringing back with startling vividness all the incidents of that day.\\r\\nThere were many relics of the fight still lying about—rotting\\r\\nheaddresses, rusty bits of accoutrements and arms, and hundreds of\\r\\nfragments of shell and half-buried round-shot. Skeletons of horses were\\r\\nplentiful, and Jack stood gazing at one, wondering whether it was that\\r\\nof his faithful Dainty, for he guessed he was about on the spot where\\r\\nshe had fallen.Going some distance farther towards the hills he kicked a large boulder\\r\\nand moved it, when he saw a piece of discoloured metal which had been\\r\\nhalf-buried by it. Stooping, he picked it up and found it was a bugle,\\r\\nwhich had been crushed and battered as though smashed with a hammer.\\r\\nCuriosity prompted him to rub away the earth and rust from the bell of\\r\\nthe instrument in order to see to which regiment it had belonged, when\\r\\nto his surprise he saw dimly{378} No. 1243, 17th Lancers. That was his\\r\\nregimental number, and the bugle was his. In a flash he recollected how\\r\\nit was dashed from his grasp by a round-shot the last time he had ever\\r\\nsounded, for on that day he ceased to be a trumpeter.He remounted and made his way to camp, taking his relic with him. When\\r\\nhe showed it to Barrymore, just outside the regimental’s tent, the\\r\\nlatter said, ‘It’s very strange your finding it; however, you must keep\\r\\nit. And that reminds me, I have a relic which, when I thought you were\\r\\ndead, I found in your tent and meant to keep.’He went into his tent and brought out an old battered lance-cap, with\\r\\nthe corners all broken down, the plate bent, a bullet-hole through the\\r\\nsquare top, and a sword-cut on the side which had cut completely down to\\r\\nthe round leather skull-piece, the cut having been stitched up with a\\r\\nbit of string.‘It is so, and since you’re here amongst us in the flesh I’ll make you a\\r\\npresent of it. Put it with your bugle. When you’re a colonel you’ll show\\r\\nthem with pride to your friends.’‘I don’t suppose that day will ever come,’ laughed Jack; ‘but anyway\\r\\nI’ll accept it, and will give it to my mother as a relic of the\\r\\nBalaclava charge.’So far as the cavalry was concerned the war was over. The troops would\\r\\nhave to be kept in the Crimea till peace was finally declared, but there\\r\\nseemed to be no further use for cavalry; and in November the ‘Death or\\r\\nGlory Boys’ embarked for Ismail, where they went into comfortable\\r\\nquarters.For several months they had a very easy time.{379} The anniversaries of the\\r\\nthree big battles were kept up in the army with great celebrations, and\\r\\nat Christmas they had a gay time.Jack had many letters from his friends, and amused himself by writing an\\r\\naccount of all that had happened to him since he had come out. One other\\r\\nhonour came to him. The men of the different regiments had to choose so\\r\\nmany of their comrades who were to be given the French war medal, and\\r\\nJack was one of those chosen by his comrades.With the cavalry, the great battle had been Balaclava, and for Jack’s\\r\\nunique experience in having ridden in both charges, and for having, as\\r\\nall the survivors of the 17th asserted, ‘brought the regiment out of\\r\\naction,’ to say nothing of him and Barrymore having rescued Captain\\r\\nNorreys, he had won the name of ‘Blair of Balaclava,’ which had ever\\r\\nsince stuck to him. So he was one of those selected for the French war\\r\\nmedal, which was presented to him at the same time as the Sardinian one.‘I shall be decorated all over soon,’ he laughed to Will as he surveyed\\r\\nthe three glittering medals on his breast. ‘I’m carrying quite a weight\\r\\nof metal.’‘And I only wish that every man who carried metal,’ said Will with a\\r\\nlaugh, ‘deserved it half as much as you do.’One day, when Jack was reading in his quarters, he heard a tremendous\\r\\ncheering from some men of the regiment. He went out, book in hand, to\\r\\nsee what was the matter.‘Well,’ growled a grizzled veteran named Penn—who had nearly twenty\\r\\nyears’ service, and who, besides having ridden beside Jack in the ‘death\\r\\nride,’ wore five medals on his breast—‘well, you needn’t open your\\r\\nmouth so wide. If you had come out with us two years ago you’d perhaps\\r\\nthink more of the chums you were leaving out here than the mincing miss\\r\\nyou think’s waiting for you at home.’ And somehow the old soldier’s\\r\\nwords found an answering echo in Jack’s heart.Nevertheless, all was joyous bustle and excitement, and when three days\\r\\nlater they embarked for home all were in high spirits. They had a\\r\\ncomfortable voyage, and the few survivors, only a handful who had come\\r\\nout from England with the regiment, used to gather on the deck in the\\r\\nevening, and while they smoked their pipes fight their battles over\\r\\nagain, and relate to one another the adventures they had passed through\\r\\nwith comrades, alas! no more.‘You and I, Will, of all the trumpeters who came out are the only two\\r\\nleft,’ said Jack one magnificent evening as he and Will leant over the\\r\\ntaffrail watching the sunset. ‘Napper dead of cholera, Brittain and\\r\\nParkes killed at Balaclava, poor old Linham and the trumpet-major\\r\\ninvalided, and Tom Callon discharged with one arm.’‘Don’t talk about it, Jack; we’ve added new honours to the regiment, but\\r\\nwe’ve paid the full price.’After a prosperous voyage the good steamer Candra dropped anchor in\\r\\nQueenstown Bay, and next day the regiment was disembarked. And then a\\r\\nsurprise was in store for the ‘Death or Glory Boys.’ The band of a\\r\\nHussar regiment came to play them to the station,{381} and when the regiment\\r\\nmarched out through the dock-gates they saw a vast multitude of people.\\r\\nEnglish troops had never been popular in Ireland; even in England they\\r\\nhad been coldly treated. The army had waned in popularity during the\\r\\nforty years of peace since the Peninsula days.But for two years the people had been full of the doings of the troops.\\r\\nThey had read with moist eyes and kindly hearts the story of the heights\\r\\nof the Alma, of the valley of Balaclava. Their feelings had been wrung\\r\\nwhen they read of the thousands dying of cholera, of cold, of\\r\\nstarvation, and of overwork before Sebastopol.Their pulses had been quickened when they learned how the ragged,\\r\\nfamished, disease-stricken handfuls had hurled back into the fog, whence\\r\\nthey emerged, the thousands of the Czar, contending on the slopes of\\r\\nInkermann from dawn almost till sunset, dying proudly—nay,\\r\\njoyously—where they stood, but never retreating. And, lastly, they had\\r\\nglowed with pride when they heard of the dogged pertinacity with which\\r\\nthe handful of heroes, struggling against almost every evil to which an\\r\\narmy is open, maintained that stubborn fight in the trenches, enduring\\r\\nwithout one word of complaint, facing with cheerfulness every danger,\\r\\nsuffering privation in silence, meeting death and wounds before the\\r\\nenemy with a smile of contempt, or willingly yielding up their lives\\r\\nfrom sickness, because they held it was their duty. Every soldier had\\r\\nfulfilled his promise to Queen and Country.And so the British soldier had shown that he was the same as the men who\\r\\nhad hurled back the flower of Napoleon’s army in the Peninsula. He had{382}\\r\\nvindicated his existence; he stood forth in the simple grandeur of his\\r\\nnature; he had shown his countrymen—nay, all the world—that he was the\\r\\nsame calm and superb fighter as of yore, and his countrymen had taken\\r\\nhim to their hearts and determined to show him they loved him.So it happened that when the Lancers entered the streets the\\r\\nwarm-hearted, impulsive Irish people gave full vent to their feelings.\\r\\nThey shouted, they cheered, they forced themselves in amongst the\\r\\nhorses, in several instances actually dismounting the Lancers. They\\r\\nshook hands with them, the women even kissing them, they pressed\\r\\npresents upon them, offered them food, drink, tobacco, and so on; and at\\r\\nlast all progress was stopped till a large body of police arrived and\\r\\nliterally forced a way for the embarrassed soldiers.‘Good heavens, Will!’ said Jack to his friend when at last they were\\r\\nsafely in the railway-station, ‘what an experience! The people seem to\\r\\nhave gone mad. I’d almost as soon go through another Balaclava as that.’‘I don’t know that I would not rather,’ said Will. ‘I’ve had three\\r\\nbuttons torn off my tunic, been nearly cut in half by people hanging on\\r\\nto my sword, and been kissed by a terrible old woman who I should think\\r\\nhas lived all her life on whisky, onions, and tobacco!’When they arrived at Cahir, where they were to be stationed, the town\\r\\nhad determined to give the Lancers a right royal welcome. The officers\\r\\nwere invited to a banquet and ball by the mayor, the non-coms, and men\\r\\nwere fêted and feasted; the townspeople pressed forward to make the\\r\\nacquaintance of the men, and{383} asked them here and there till every one\\r\\nwas tired. They soon got to know which of the men had ridden in the\\r\\nfamous charge, and every one who wore the clasp with Balaclava on it was\\r\\ncertain of a warm and hearty welcome.Things presently began to settle down into the usual home routine, many\\r\\nmen went away on furlough, and Jack himself was hoping to get away. He\\r\\nwas sent off one day to Queenstown to meet some details from the depôt,\\r\\nreturning next day.When on the next morning he passed through the gate he almost burst out\\r\\nlaughing as the sentry smartly ‘carried’ his lance and brought his left\\r\\nhand across his body till it touched the lance in salute.Marching his men to the orderly-room, Jack was crossing the square when\\r\\nhe met Sergeant-major Barrymore. Instead of the usual cheery,\\r\\n‘Good-morning, Jack,’ the regimental passed his whip under his left arm,\\r\\nfaced Jack, and saluted him as he would the colonel.‘It means, sir,’ said Barrymore with a smile, ‘that you were gazetted\\r\\nsome days ago to a cornetcy by purchase, and were in orders last night\\r\\nas posted to B Troop.’‘Not at all,’ cried a voice from behind, and Jack saw Colonel Norreys\\r\\nand the adjutant. ‘Blair,’ continued the colonel, shaking hands with\\r\\nJack, ‘I’m happy to welcome you as a brother-officer; you’re an{384} honour\\r\\nto the regiment. Come over to the mess; there’s some one there waiting\\r\\nto see you.’Feeling as if he were walking on air, Jack followed his colonel, and was\\r\\nsoon shaking hands with his uncle, Colonel Harrington.‘My dear Jack, how well you are looking!’ cried Colonel Harrington, ‘and\\r\\nwhat a show of medals you’ve got there! I intended to give you a little\\r\\nsurprise over the matter of your commission, but was unfortunate in\\r\\nfinding you away from barracks.’‘By saying nothing about it. And, besides, it’s as much my old friend\\r\\nColonel Leland’s doing as mine. I had no idea he knew you till I met him\\r\\nin London. He’s an old comrade of mine.’‘You have me, Jack. I am a miserable old bachelor having no one to care\\r\\nfor. I am going to adopt you as my son, and in return for what you have\\r\\ndone for me I intend to leave you my fortune.’‘All well, and, by Jove, aren’t the girls handsome? You’ll open your\\r\\neyes when you see them, young man, for they must have altered much in\\r\\nthe last two years.’‘We start to-night,’ said Colonel Harrington. ‘I have just arranged with\\r\\nyour colonel here, and I have got you two months’ leave. There are\\r\\nclothes, uniform, and all sorts of things to see to, settlements to\\r\\nmake, and I don’t know what, all of which we must go to London to do.{385}’That night Jack dined for the first time in the officers’ mess, and as\\r\\nhe entered in his sergeant’s uniform he received a magnificent\\r\\nreception.They caught the night train, and at noon next day arrived in London.\\r\\nJack did, indeed, stare with surprise at the handsome, elegant young\\r\\nladies who stood beside his mother; he could hardly believe they were\\r\\nhis sisters, so much had they altered, and they stared in surprise at\\r\\nthe tall, broad, bronzed soldier, with the glittering medals and the\\r\\nincipient moustache.But when Mrs Blair hung round his neck and sobbed out her thanks that\\r\\nher dear boy had been preserved to her amidst all the terrible dangers\\r\\nhe had passed through, he knew that at least she had not changed.The Lelands were there to welcome Jack, who noticed that his now\\r\\nfellow-officer Captain Leland, who had gone home on leave directly he\\r\\nhad arrived in Ireland, kept very close to Molly, and that they seemed\\r\\nvery pleased with one another. And the way in which Colonel Harrington\\r\\nbeamed on them all did Jack’s heart good.That night Mrs Blair confessed to Jack that her reconciliation with her\\r\\nbrother and her family had given her more pleasure than she could tell;\\r\\nand, thanks to the colonel’s business acumen, on going over her late\\r\\nhusband’s affairs with Mr Bailey he found that the old lawyer had much\\r\\nneglected and muddled things, and that Mrs Blair was much better off\\r\\nthan she had supposed. Judicious changes and speculations made by the\\r\\ncolonel, and a lawsuit successfully undertaken, had more than trebled\\r\\nher income.{386}‘So that, my dear Jack,’ she said, ‘as I am afraid I shall soon lose\\r\\nMolly, for she and Harry Leland seem to have made a match of it, I shall\\r\\nhave more than enough for myself and the other two girls to live on in\\r\\nease and comparative luxury.{387}’Manufactured of bronze, cast from cannon taken at Sebastopol, the\\r\\nintrinsic value is fourpence halfpenny; but millions of money could not\\r\\nbuy the right to wear that little Maltese cross. Underneath the\\r\\nlion-surmounted crown are the words, ‘For Valour!’ and valour alone,\\r\\nvalour on the battlefield, can win for the soldier or sailor the\\r\\nproudest decoration a British subject can wear.Amongst the sixty-two heroes to be decorated that day were two men\\r\\nwearing the handsome blue and white of the ‘Death or Glory Boys.’ They\\r\\nwere Cornet Blair and Sergeant-major Barrymore. The Gazette records\\r\\nthe deeds by which they earned the cross as follows:‘For distinguished bravery at Balaclava on 25th October 1854, in\\r\\nrescuing Captain Norreys under a heavy fire; and, while both wounded, at\\r\\nthe risk of their own lives in gallantly bringing him out of danger.’Never will Jack forget the roaring, cheering thousands the little band\\r\\npassed through as they marched from Portman Barracks to the Park. There\\r\\nwere{388} assembled representative regiments of the different branches which\\r\\nhad served in the Crimea, while the ground was kept by infantry and\\r\\ncavalry of the Household Brigade.Jack and his comrades, officers and privates all together, were drawn up\\r\\nin line; and, just before ten, her Majesty, dressed in a sort of\\r\\nuniform, and mounted on horseback, appeared on the scene.Then the heroes were presented to her by name by the Secretary of State\\r\\nfor War, and her Majesty, with a few kind words, pinned to each man’s\\r\\nbreast the coveted cross. Among them was one old comrade of Jack’s,\\r\\nParkes the giant trooper of the 4th Light Dragoons, who had been in\\r\\nprison at Voronesh with him.The presentation over, the troops marched past. Lord Cardigan, on the\\r\\nhorse he had ridden in the celebrated charge, led by at a gallop his\\r\\nregiment, the 11th Hussars, many a Balaclava man still serving with\\r\\nthem; and the Inniskilling Dragoons were also on the ground.When the Queen left the ground a mad rush was made by the crowd to shake\\r\\nhands with the newly decorated heroes; but Jack, with the recollection\\r\\nof their reception in Ireland fresh in his mind, had arranged with his\\r\\nuncle Colonel Harrington, who had his carriage on the ground, into which\\r\\nJack and Barrymore got directly the Queen went, and were driven off to\\r\\nRegent’s Park Terrace, to the town house of Colonel Harrington.There a number of our old friends were assembled. A dinner-party was\\r\\nbeing held in Jack’s honour that night, and Colonel Harrington had told\\r\\nJack he could ask whoever he liked. Colonel Norreys and Captain{389} Leland\\r\\nwere there, and Jack determined to have his humbler friends Will Hodson\\r\\nand Jimmy Linham, who were honoured guests. Colonel Harrington had asked\\r\\nColonel Leland and Jack’s old colonel, then a General, who came with\\r\\nLinham. These two lived together, Linham being ostensibly General\\r\\nRawlence’s valet; in reality he was a companion, and the two were never\\r\\nhappy out of each other’s sight. Jimmy’s wounds had healed, and he was\\r\\ncured except that he walked with a stiff leg.During the afternoon a servant approached Jack and said a young\\r\\ngentleman and an old lady had called, and begged a minute’s interview.\\r\\nJack immediately went to the drawing-room, where he saw a ruddy-looking,\\r\\nfair young man, whose empty sleeve buttoned to his coat showed he had\\r\\nonly one arm. This young man coloured when he saw Jack, and began,\\r\\n‘Pardon my liberty in calling; but being in London I couldn’t go\\r\\nwithout’——‘Tom, Tom, dear old Tom Callon!’ cried Jack, seizing him by his one\\r\\nhand, ‘this is indeed the only thing wanting to complete my happiness.’‘This is kind, sir, most kind,’ said Tom, ‘to greet me like this. Of\\r\\ncourse now you’re an officer and a V.C.’‘Bosh and nonsense. My old comrades, who shared the dangers of the\\r\\nCrimea with me, I am and always shall be happy to see.’The old lady here had to shed a few tears. ‘Is this the gentleman, Tom,\\r\\nas saved your life?’ she asked gently.‘Indeed, sir,’ said the old lady dropping a curtsey,{390} ‘he talks of you\\r\\nby the hour. If an old woman’s blessings and prayers are of any value\\r\\nyou have mine, for you saved to me my son, my only boy, and now my sole\\r\\nsupport.”‘Say no more, Mrs Callon. What I did for Tom he would have done for me.\\r\\nWe all did our best in the war.’‘It’s most kind of you to say so, sir, and coming from one who this very\\r\\nday I saw our blessed Queen, with her own hands, present a medal to, I\\r\\ntake the liberty of saying it’s a great honour, and if you would shake\\r\\nhands with me’——‘I’ll do more, Mrs Callon; I’ll kiss you,’ and Jack suited the action to\\r\\nthe word, and then said, ‘You must see my mother and sisters, Mrs\\r\\nCallon, and have a cup of tea, while Tom and I have a talk.’Over a glass of wine Tom related how he had his arm amputated at Scutari\\r\\nand been invalided home, and how, while he had been in hospital, Colonel\\r\\nLeland and his daughter had visited the place, and seeing his name and\\r\\nregiment above his bed had asked him if he knew Jack Blair. Then he had\\r\\ntold his tale, and the colonel had taken an interest in him, and when he\\r\\nwas well had given him a position as a sort of under-bailiff on his\\r\\nestate.‘So you see, Jack,’ he concluded, ‘as you say I may still call you so,\\r\\nI’m far better off, and quite as happy as if I’d remained in the\\r\\nservice, and also I am able to keep the old mother in comfort, which I\\r\\ncould not otherwise have done.’When after dinner the ladies had retired—which Captain Leland seemed to\\r\\nbe in no hurry that they{391} should do, holding open the door for them, and\\r\\nhis eyes following Miss Molly up the stair—the gentlemen, all soldiers,\\r\\nmost of whom had ridden in that fatal and historic charge, settled down\\r\\nto their wine and cigars. The toast of the Queen was duly drunk, and\\r\\nthen Sergeant Linham, who was a little flushed, rose to his feet. He\\r\\nlooked round him and blew violently down his nose.‘Gentlemen and comrades,’ he said, ‘there are some here who never served\\r\\nin the glorious old 17th, some who did not share the dangers of the\\r\\ncharge at Balaclava; but these I am sure will be as ready to drink my\\r\\ntoast as those who did. Gentlemen, I give you the gallant four hundred\\r\\nwho gave their lives for their country on that day.’The toast was drunk amidst dead silence, and then Linham, filling his\\r\\nglass again, continued, ‘Ha, hum! gentlemen, though most here are\\r\\nofficers, you will grant a plain soldier a word. I want to give you the\\r\\nhealth of one whom I’m proud to call friend—Jack Blair. The Queen, God\\r\\nbless her, has honoured him to-day, has honoured me, has honoured the\\r\\nold “Death or Glory Boys,” has honoured us all in honouring him. She\\r\\nbestowed on him the greatest prize a soldier can win, the Victoria\\r\\nCross, and I ask you—I ask you all—who is there more worthy to be\\r\\nhonoured?’‘Ha, hum!’ continued the sergeant, ‘you don’t answer. There is no\\r\\nanswer; you all agree. Our respected officer Colonel Norreys led us into\\r\\nthe charge, but who brought us out if Jack didn’t? I give you his\\r\\nhealth, “Blair of Balaclava,” with three times three!{392}’‘No other toast shall ever be drunk out of that glass,’ he said proudly;\\r\\n‘and, ha, hum! you toads—I mean gentlemen—if Jack Blair hasn’t got\\r\\ncause to be proud this day I want to know who has? I want to know?’And no answer being vouchsafed, Jimmy Linham sat down, convinced that\\r\\nhis question was unanswerable, as indeed it was.[2] This is the nickname of the 11th Hussars, so called on\\r\\naccount of a number of them having been taken prisoners in a\\r\\ncherry-orchard during the Peninsular war.[4] The losses incurred by our troops in the Crimea, from\\r\\ncholera and other diseases, was a lasting disgrace to English\\r\\nadministration. When, through the letters of Dr W. H. Russell, the Times\\r\\ncorrespondent in the Crimea, the facts became known, the popular wave of\\r\\nindignation it aroused swept the inept Ministry from power. So far as\\r\\nthe men were concerned, a finer army than the one sent to the Crimea, or\\r\\none worse provided for, never left our shores. It is not too much to say\\r\\nthat the transport, commissariat, and medical services, as we now\\r\\nunderstand the terms, did not exist. We had been at peace too long, we\\r\\nhad lost the art of making war, the lessons of the Peninsular campaign\\r\\nhad been forgotten. The men were sent to face a severe Russian winter in\\r\\nthin clothing, there were practically no tents, no blankets, no medical\\r\\nstores, no reserve clothing; but little food and less forage. The result\\r\\nwas that sickness was rampant, the men died off by scores and hundreds,\\r\\nsome regiments losing so many as to be disregimented, as were the 5th\\r\\nDragoon Guards. Our total loss from cholera was about four thousand\\r\\nthree hundred; from other diseases, largely the result of starvation,\\r\\noverwork, and exposure in the trenches, sixteen thousand; the number\\r\\nkilled or who died of their wounds was three thousand five hundred and\\r\\nseventeen; so that for every man killed by the Russians we lost nearly\\r\\nsix by disease. These numbers speak for themselves.[5] The distinction of having sounded the charge that sent so\\r\\nmany brave fellows to their death down the valley of Balaclava has been\\r\\nclaimed by, and on behalf of, several people. Amongst others the\\r\\ndistinction has been claimed for Trumpet-major H. Joy of the 17th\\r\\nLancers. He was staff-trumpeter to Lord Lucan, and was with his lordship\\r\\non the day of the charge. The bugle which Joy carried in the Crimea was\\r\\nsold by public auction in 1894, and was bought for the fabulous sum of\\r\\nseven hundred and fifty guineas. The bugle bears this inscription:\\r\\n‘Presented by the colonel of the 17th Lancers to Trumpet-major Joy, on\\r\\nwhich the Balaclava charge was sounded, October 25th, 1854.’ On the\\r\\ndeath of the first purchaser the bugle was resold, fetching less than a\\r\\nthird of the original price. It was presented to the United Service\\r\\nInstitution in Whitehall, where it now is. The Earl of Lucan was in\\r\\ncommand of all the cavalry in the Crimea; his brigade commanders were\\r\\nresponsible for carrying out his orders. After Lord Lucan, on the\\r\\nmorning of the charge, had given Lord Cardigan his orders, beyond moving\\r\\nthe 11th Hussars from the front to the second rank, he had nothing more\\r\\nto do with the Light Brigade. From the moment when Cardigan said simply,\\r\\n‘The brigade will advance,’ it received no orders from any one else. It\\r\\nregulated its speed and took its direction from Cardigan alone, who rode\\r\\nabout five horses’ lengths in front of the first line. Lord Lucan and,\\r\\nof course, his orderly trumpeter, remained behind with the heavy\\r\\ndragoons, and whoever may have sounded the fatal charge, no military\\r\\nman will believe that it was Trumpet-major Joy. Survivors of the charge\\r\\ndeny that it was sounded at all, and when it is remembered that the\\r\\nbrigade had some mile and a quarter to ride before it got to the guns,\\r\\nand that the men were almost mad with excitement long before the time to\\r\\n‘charge,’ in the true military sense, had come, it is more than probable\\r\\nthat the call was not sounded. If, however, it was sounded, it would\\r\\nhave been by Trumpeter Brittain of the 17th Lancers, who was Lord\\r\\nCardigan’s orderly trumpeter, and should have been taken up by the other\\r\\ntrumpeters from him. But Brittain was severely wounded before the guns\\r\\nwere reached. He was taken to Scutari hospital where he died, not from\\r\\nhis wounds, but from the privation and neglect that he, in common with\\r\\nthe other wounded, had to suffer through the lamentable lack of all that\\r\\nwas necessary for the comfort and welfare of the patients.[6] The total casualties of the Allies at Balaclava was about\\r\\nsix hundred. Of these the cavalry lost, killed or wounded, three hundred\\r\\nand ninety, of which two hundred and forty-seven were in the Light\\r\\nBrigade. The strength of the brigade when it started down the valley has\\r\\nbeen differently stated; but the following return, taken from various\\r\\nsources, is probably correct. Some men who had been unhorsed or wounded\\r\\nmanaged to get back to their regiments later on, and some who had been\\r\\ntaken prisoners afterwards rejoined. This table shows only the number of\\r\\nmen who answered to their names at the first roll-call after the charge:\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal loss of the brigade, 67 per cent. There were also, killed or\\r\\nwounded, five hundred and twenty horses.[8] Equal to about eightpence in English money, but going as\\r\\nfar in Russia as two shillings and sixpence.[9] The losses of the English have been already given in note\\r\\non pp. 207-8. The French lost in all about sixty-three thousand and\\r\\neighty men. But the Russian loss in officers and men reached the huge\\r\\ntotal of over a quarter of a million! Inkermann alone cost them twelve\\r\\nthousand, while during the hottest part of the bombardment the Russians\\r\\nlost about seven hundred men daily.'"
