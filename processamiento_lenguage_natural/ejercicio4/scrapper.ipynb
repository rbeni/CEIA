      "method of raising revenue which had been\n",
      "arranged in his grandfather’s time. That\n",

      "by way of composition for the rents of\n",
      "royal lands in the shire, and the ordinary\n",
      "proceeds of the fines and other payments\n",

      "Ethelred, but continued, like the Income Tax, as a convenient\n",

      "[Pg 56]arising from the profits of marriages, wardships,\n",
      "transfers of land, successions, and the like, and from the\n",
      "aids demanded by the king from the several barons or\n",
      "communities that owed him feudal support. To these\n",
      "we may add a fourth source, the proceeds of courts of\n",

      "his judicial staff, year after year, through the country,\n",

      "despotic nobles, and spreading the feeling of security\n",
      "together with the sense of loyalty, and the conviction\n",
      "that ready justice was well worth the money that it\n",
      "seemed to cost. Besides the revival of the provincial\n",
      "judicature in this shape Henry, from the beginning of\n",

      "of his supreme court of justice, which comes into prominence\n",
      "later on.\n",
      "188 1488 Next to these his most important measure was the\n",
      "institution or expansion of what is called Scutage. According\n",
      "to the ancient English law every\n",
      "freeman was bound to serve in arms for the\n",
      "defence of his country. That principle Henry only\n",
      "meddled with so far as to direct and improve it. But,\n",
      "according to the feudal custom, quite irrespective of this,[Pg 57]\n",
      "every man who held land to the amount of twenty pounds’\n",
      "worth of annual value was obliged to perform or furnish\n",
      "the military service of a knight to his immediate lord.\n",
      "This kept the barons always at the head of bodies of\n",
      "trained knights, who might be regarded as ultimately a\n",
      "part of the king’s army, but in case of a rebellion would\n",
      "probably fight for their immediate lord. Henry, by allowing\n",
      "his vassals to commute their military service for\n",
      "a money payment, went a long way to disarm this very\n",
      "untrustworthy body; and with the money so raised he\n",
      "hired stipendiaries, with whom he fought his Continental\n",
      "wars. He began to act on this principle in the first year\n",
      "of his reign, when he made the bishops, notwithstanding\n",
      "strong objections from Archbishop Theobald, pay scutage\n",
      "for their lands held by knight-service. But in 1159\n",
      "he extended the plan very widely, and took money instead\n",

      "189 260 By thus disarming the feudal potentates, and forcing\n",

      "Until now, whenever money was\n",

      "the national council, the assembly of\n",
      "bishops, earls, and great vassals, and others, and the\n",
      "method was explained by which they were to be satisfied.\n",
      "If he wanted to marry his daughter, or to knight\n",

      "archbishop objecting to the royal dealings with the\n",
      "Danegeld, and thus asserting the right of the national\n",

      "the Confessor—who had, as the\n",

      "up his cause, and either by urging the Pope to extreme\n",

      "he had let Normandy fall out of his hands, he had spoiled\n",
      "them and put them to shame, implicating them in his own\n",

      "Simon de Montfort, the persecutor of the Albigensian\n",
      "heretics, who had, at the head of that cruel crusade,\n",
      "been made Count of Toulouse, and perished in making\n",
      "good his claims. The Counts of Evreux, his remoter[Pg 194]\n",
      "ancestors, had made their way into that position by a\n",
      "fortunate marriage as early as the time of Henry I.\n",
      "They had made a bold attempt in the time of Lewis VI.\n",
      "to claim the high stewardship of France; in later times\n",
      "one of the family had held, in the right of his wife, the\n",
      "earldom of Gloucester after the death of Geoffrey de\n",
      "Mandeville and Hawisia. Earl Simon, the Crusader,\n",
      "was a nephew of the last Earl of Leicester of the house\n",
      "of Beaumont, on whose death John divided his earldom\n",
      "into two, that of Winchester going to Saer de Quincy as\n",
      "co-heir, and that of Leicester to Simon de Montfort.\n",
      "But that Simon, although he was Earl of Leicester, had\n",
      "little to do with England; he was an enemy of John,\n",
      "and the barons are said, at one time, to have thought\n",
      "of calling him in as a deliverer. His crusade against\n",
      "the Albigenses was directed really against Raymond of\n",
      "Toulouse, who was John’s brother-in-law; and as John\n",
      "was never loth to keep the lands of his enemies in his\n",
      "own hands, the revenues of the earldom seldom found\n",
      "their way into the treasury of the Montforts. This Simon\n",
      "had four sons; Amalric, Count of Montfort, was the\n",
      "eldest, and the second Simon, the hero of the barons’\n",
      "war, was the youngest. Amalric, of course, was his father’s\n",
      "heir, but he contented himself with his patrimony\n",
      "in France; and the two intermediate brothers being now\n",
      "dead, Simon, according to Matthew Paris, attempted, at\n",
      "the Council of Bourges, in 1226 or 1227, to recover the\n",
      "county of Toulouse. Failing to do this, he came to England\n",
      "to see whether he could not get the earldom of\n",
      "Leicester, and his brother consented to make over to\n",
      "him such rights in it as he possessed. After some years\n",
      "he succeeded. Henry allowed the arrangement between\n",
      "the brothers to take effect, and gave Simon the honor of\n",
      "Leicester. He had already failed in two attempts to[Pg 195]\n",
      "make himself a great position by marriage with the\n",
      "countesses of Flanders and Boulogne. In a third he\n",
      "was more successful; Henry connived, as it was said,\n",
      "at a clandestine marriage between Simon and his sister\n",

      "obtaining the recognition of his marriage as lawful.\n",
      "603 1942 For some years he appears to have been coolly treated,\n",
      "and perhaps nursed his wrongs. But up to this time\n",

      "foreigners with whom England swarmed. By what process\n",
      "he educated himself into the ideas and position of\n",
      "an English baron, we have but little information to show.\n",
      "It is clear, however, that he did so; that he had much\n",
      "intercourse with the clergy, especially with that section\n",
      "which, with Bishop Grosseteste, was bent on resisting\n",
      "the royal exactions and papal usurpations; that he devoted\n",
      "much thought and care to the education of his\n",
      "children; and that when, in the parliament of 1244, the\n",
      "prelates and barons selected a committee to treat with\n",
      "the king, his name, with that of Earl Richard of Cornwall,\n",
      "was among the first chosen. In his own earldom,\n",
      "nearly the only notice found of him, is that he\n",
      "persecuted the Jews of Leicester, and this slight indication\n",
      "may show that he had somewhat of his father’s\n",
      "spirit—that some persecuting zeal was an ingredient in\n",
      "his peculiar form of piety. From this date we find him,\n",
      "however, employed more and more in public business,\n",
      "and for several years together commanding in Gascony,[Pg 196]\n",
      "where the complaints of his severity and impolicy were\n",
      "probably occasioned as much by Henry’s deceitful treatment\n",
      "of his foreign adherents, as by Simon’s own fault.\n",
      "Of this, however, it is impossible to judge certainly; we\n",
      "only know that the bitter feelings which existed between\n",
      "him and the king were constantly more and more embittered,\n",
      "and that Earl Richard, although sometimes he\n",
      "was obliged to take Simon’s part, had the same personal\n",
      "antipathy, which grew greater, and produced terrible\n",
      "results in the next generation. In Gascony, however,\n",
      "Simon must have gained a good deal of political experience;\n",
      "and he was already by inherited talent and early\n",

      "604 974 Such was the man whom Henry III. had raised and\n",

      "all transgressions of that principle, whether within the\n",

      "on the wool of the country any such “maletote”[Pg 252]\n",
      "or heavy custom in future without their common assent\n",

      "ideas of the barons of 1258, and had perhaps an indistinct\n",
      "notion of overthrowing the influence of Lancaster\n",
      "by an alliance with the commons. The younger Hugh,[Pg 278]\n",

      "than to the person of the sovereign, and that if the king\n",

      "of the right of parliament than had ever been put forth\n",
      "by Lancaster, and it would seem probable that they\n",
      "hoped by maintaining the theory of national action, as\n",
      "stated by Edward I., to strengthen their master’s position,\n",

      "however, was the political morality of the time, that the\n",
